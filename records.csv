"ABSTRACT","INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography (CT) is an essential part of trauma patient initial workup. Rapid performance of CT has become the standard of care in most parts of the world. This study aims to assess if the time to CT has changed over a 10-year period at the study centre and examine the potential impact on patient outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective audit of prospectively collected trauma registry from 2010 to 2019 was performed, including trauma presentations to John Hunter Hospital (n = 9712) with injury severity score above 15. CT data, including start time, end time, time to CT and body region imaged, were collected from RIS-PACS. RESULTS: Time to CT over the 10-year period ranged from 6 to 299, with a mean of 92 min. Regression analysis showed no overall change in time to CT. Patients who arrived intubated, polytrauma patients and those with isolated head injuries had faster time to CT. Longer time to CT was seen in patients hypotensive on arrival. CONCLUSIONS: Time to CT in trauma patients has not changed over a 10-year period, remaining below international standards. In-hospital mortality of major trauma patients at our institution continued to decrease over the study timeframe, resulting in one of the lowest risk-adjusted mortality rates in the country. Development and publication of an Australian KPI for Time to CT in Trauma patients is an important next step in Australian trauma policy and guidelines. This study will serve as a baseline for reassessment of trauma patient initial management workflow within the hospital following the addition of a new acute care services block, protocols for suitable major trauma patients to bypass the emergency resuscitation bay, and a CT hybrid room through our institution's expansion."

"ABSTRACT","PURPOSE: Our aim was to develop new evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations for imaging strategies in patients with multiple and/or severe injuries in the resuscitation room. This guideline topic is part of the 2022 update of the German Guideline on the Treatment of Patients with Multiple and/or Severe Injuries. METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched to August 2021. INCLUSION CRITERIA: patients with multiple and/or severe injuries in the resuscitation room, randomised controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and comparative registry studies; comparison of interventions for imaging strategies; patient-relevant clinical outcomes such as diagnostic test accuracy and mortality. Further literature reports were obtained from clinical experts. We considered patient-relevant clinical outcomes such as diagnostic test accuracy and mortality. Risk of bias was assessed using NICE 2012 checklists. The evidence was synthesised narratively, and expert consensus was used to develop recommendations and determine their strength. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies with a total of 55,227 patients were identified. There were studies with low risk (n = 2), high risk (n = 5) and unclear risk of bias (n = 14). Relevant topics were sonographic imaging of the chest and abdomen (n = 8 studies), X-ray of the chest (n = 1), indications for whole-body computed tomography (n = 6), CT scanner location (n = 1), whole-body computed tomography in haemodynamically unstable patients (n = 3), and prehospital sonography (n = 2). There were studies with low risk (n = 2), high risk (n = 5) and unclear risk of bias (n = 14). One new recommendation was developed, six were modified. All achieved strong consensus. CONCLUSION: While extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma should be performed for diagnostic purposes after blunt and/or penetrating thoracic and/or abdominal trauma as part of the primary survey in the resuscitation room, whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) gains highest importance as part of the diagnostic procedures for severely injured patients. WBCT with a trauma-specific protocol must be performed in a timely manner if the patient does not require an immediate intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging can be indicated as a further primary diagnostic tool for specific conditions. Two studies were judged to be of low risk of bias in all domains. The risk of selection bias was high in two studies and unclear in seven studies."

"ABSTRACT","Abdominopelvic trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, typically resulting from high-energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle collisions and penetrating injuries. Admission abdominopelvic trauma CT, performed either selectively or as part of a whole-body CT protocol, has become the workhorse screening and surgical planning modality due to improvements in speed and image quality. Radiography remains an essential element of the secondary trauma survey, and Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scanning has added value for quick assessment of non-compressible hemorrhage in hemodynamically unstable patients. Complex and severe polytrauma cases often delay radiology report turnaround times, which can potentially impede urgent clinical decision-making. Artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) offers promising solutions for enhanced diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in abdominopelvic trauma imaging. Although commercial AI tools for abdominopelvic trauma are currently available for only a few use cases, the literature reveals robust research and development (R&D) of prototype tools. Multiscale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models are capable of detecting and quantifying solid organ injuries, fractures, and hemorrhage with a high degree of precision. Further, generalist foundation models such as multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) can be adapted and fine-tuned using imaging, clinical, and text data for a range of tasks, including detection, quantitative visualization, prognostication, and report auto-generation. Despite their promise, for most use cases in abdominopelvic trauma, AI CAD tools remain in the pilot stages of technology readiness, with persistent challenges related to data availability; the need for open-access PACS compatible software pipelines for pre-clinical shadow-testing; lack of well-designed multi-institutional validation studies; and regulatory hurdles. This narrative review provides a snapshot of the current state of AI in abdominopelvic trauma, examining existing commercial tools; research and development throughout the technology readiness pipeline; and future directions in this domain."

"ABSTRACT","Brief SummaryPediatric trauma assessment is challenging due to difficulties in obtaining information, which increases the need for unnecessary imaging. Trauma-related injuries remain a significant cause of death in children. Although whole-body computed tomography (CT) is frequently used due to a lower threshold for imaging, issues such as high radiation exposure arise. To reduce unnecessary radiation exposure in pediatric trauma patients, scoring systems such as PePCI (Pediatric Polytrauma CT Indication Score) and ManTIS (Manchester Trauma Imaging Score) have been developed. These studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in predicting the need for CT scans and preventing unnecessary examinations. However, both studies are retrospective analyses limited to a single region. Therefore, a prospective study is planned in Türkiye to evaluate the reliability and applicability of these scoring systems and their real-world benefits.Detailed DescriptionThe assessment of trauma in children is challenging due to difficulties in obtaining information about the mechanism and process of trauma, which leads doctors to perform more imaging. Although the incidence of fatal injuries in children has decreased in the last decade, trauma-related injuries remain a leading cause of death among children over one-year-old. Due to the lower imaging threshold in children compared to adults, whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) is frequently used. WBCT is an essential tool for the rapid diagnosis of injuries, especially in hemodynamically unstable pediatric multi-trauma patients. The most accurate criteria for activating the trauma team in pediatric trauma patients are still being debated. According to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines, the trauma team is activated based on the mechanism of injury; thus, WBCT is performed even in hemodynamically stable pediatric patients. This situation leads to unnecessary radiation exposure, increased costs, and resource wastage. Although the mechanism of injury does not constitute a sufficient indication for WBCT in pediatric patients, many trauma patients are evaluated with WBCT to avoid missing potential injuries. In pediatric emergency department patients, it is known that WBCT is not associated with a reduction in mortality but is linked to high radiation exposure and increased lifetime risk for leukemia, solid cancers, and brain tumors. Therefore, although we know the benefits of targeted emergency CT scans, the usefulness of WBCT imaging for pediatric trauma patients is debated. The severity of injuries, especially in multi-trauma patients, is classified using the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The ISS is based on an anatomical ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 75 points, with low scores representing mild injuries and high scores representing severe and fatal injuries. Generally, an ISS \>15 indicates serious injuries. This scoring system is also applicable to children and adolescents. However, pediatric patients show lower mortality for the same ISS compared to adults, attributed to physiological response differences between adults and children. Therefore, a new classification for injury severity in pediatric patients has been proposed. While an ISS \>15 in adults indicates serious injury, an ISS \>23 in the pediatric population indicates serious injury, and patients with an ISS \>26 may have functional impairments at discharge. To reduce unnecessary radiation exposure and prevent resource wastage in pediatric trauma patients, a new study was conducted by Strahl and colleagues. The study involved pediatric emergency patients with high-energy trauma mechanisms at a Level I trauma center in Germany. As a result of this study, a pediatric polytrauma CT indication score (PePCI) was developed to analyze pediatric trauma patients and reduce radiation exposure. The performance of this score was compared with the ISS. In this study, cases were screened retrospectively. It was found that WBCT was applied to 243 pediatric trauma patients. If the PePCI score had been applied to pediatric trauma patients, it could have been determined that WBCT would not have been necessary for 76 of the 243 patients they screened. Moreover, no significant injuries would have been overlooked. Another single-center study conducted by Davies and colleagues in the United Kingdom (UK) demonstrated that a large patient group in the UK is exposed to unnecessary radiation. This situation is thought to increase the risk of life-threatening outcomes, such as malignancy, in the future. With appropriate evaluation, it has been shown that WBCT imaging may not be necessary for some trauma patients. A scoring system called the Manchester Trauma Imaging Score (ManTIS) has been developed to facilitate this evaluation. The ManTIS score has been shown to safely reduce the number of unnecessary WBCTs in the young patient group. Although these studies have shown that the PePCI and ManTIS scores effectively predict the need for WBCT and prevent unnecessary scans, they have been conducted in a single region. The developed scoring systems are only applicable to specific geographical areas. Additionally, both studies were retrospective. Therefore, this study plans to prospectively evaluate the reliability, applicability, and practicality of these scores in clinical practice in Türkiye, assessing their real-life benefits."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: Whole blood (WB) has recently gained increased popularity as an adjunct to the resuscitation of hemorrhaging civilian trauma patients. We aimed to assess the nationwide outcomes of using WB as an adjunct to component therapy (CT) versus CT alone in resuscitating geriatric trauma patients. Methods: We performed a 5-y (2017-2021) retrospective analysis of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program. We included geriatric (age, ≥65 y) trauma patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock (shock index >1) and requiring at least 4 units of packed red blood cells in 4 h. Patients with severe head injuries (head Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥3) and transferred patients were excluded. Patients were stratified into WB-CT versus CT only. Primary outcomes were 6-h, 24-h, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were major complications. Multivariable regression analysis was performed, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: A total of 1194 patients were identified, of which 141 (12%) received WB. The mean ± standard deviation age was 74 ± 7 y, 67.5% were male, and 83.4% had penetrating injuries. The median [interquartile range] Injury Severity Score was 19 [13-29], with no difference among study groups (P = 0.059). Overall, 6-h, 24-h, and in-hospital mortality were 16%, 23.1%, and 43.6%, respectively. On multivariable regression analysis, WB was independently associated with reduced 24-h (odds ratio, 0.62 [0.41-0.94]; P = 0.024), and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.60 [0.40-0.90]; P = 0.013), but not with major complications (odds ratio, 0.78 [0.53-1.15]; P = 0.207). Conclusions: Transfusion of WB as an adjunct to CT is associated with improved early and overall mortality in geriatric trauma patients presenting with severe hemorrhage. The findings from this study are clinically important, as this is an essential first step in prioritizing the selection of WB resuscitation for geriatric trauma patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock."

"ABSTRACT","Trauma is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. It is crucial to diagnose trauma patients quickly to provide effective treatment interventions in such conditions. Whole-body computed tomography (WBCT)/pan-scan is an imaging technique that enables a faster and more efficient diagnosis for polytrauma patients. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of WBCT in diagnosing injuries in polytrauma patients. We will also assess its impact on the mortality rate and length of hospital stay among trauma centers between patients who underwent WBCT and those who did not (non-WBCT). Twenty-seven studies meeting our inclusion criteria were selected among PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The criteria were centered on the significance of WBCT/pan-scan application in trauma patients. Stata version 15 was used to perform statistical analysis on the data. The authors have also used I(2) statistics to evaluate heterogeneity. Egger and Begg’s tests were performed to rule out any publication bias. Total of twenty-seven studies including 68,838 trauma patients with a mean age of 45.0 ± 24.7 years were selected. Motor vehicle collisions were the most common cause of blunt injuries (80.0%). Head, neck, and face injuries were diagnosed in 44% (95% CI, 0.28–0.60; I(2) = 99.8%), 6% (95% CI, 0.02–0.09; I(2) = 97.2%), and 9% (95% CI, 0.05–0.13; I(2) = 97.1%), respectively. Chest injuries were diagnosed by WBCT in 39% (95% CI, 0.28–0.51; I(2) = 99.8%), abdominal injuries in 23% (95% CI, 0.03–0.43; I(2) = 99.9%) of cases, spinal injuries 19% (95% CI, 0.11–0.27; I(2) = 99.4%), extremity injuries 33% (95% CI, 0.23–0.43; I(2) = 99.2%), and pelvic injuries 11% (95% CI, 0.04–0.18; I(2) = 97.4%). A mortality odd ratio of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.83–1.06; I(2) = 40.1%) was calculated while comparing WBCT and non-WBCT groups. This systematic review and meta-analysis provide insight into the possible safety, efficacy, and efficiency of WBCT/pan-scan as a diagnostic tool for trauma patients with serious injuries, regardless of their hemodynamic status. In patients with serious injuries from trauma, whether or not there are indicators of hemodynamic instability, our recommended approach is to, wherever possible, perform a WBCT without stopping the hemostatic resuscitation. By using this technology, the optimal surgical strategy for these patients can be decided upon without causing any delays in their final care or greatly raising their radiation dose."

"ABSTRACT","The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) approach is generally accepted as the standard of care for the initial management of severely injured patients. While whole body computed tomography (WBCT) is still considered a contraindication in haemodynamically unstable trauma patients, there is a growing amount of data indicating the absence of harm from cross sectional imaging in this patient group. Our study aimed to compare the early mortality of unstable trauma patients undergoing a WBCT during the initial workup with those who did not. Single-center retrospective observational study based on the local trauma registry including 3525 patients with an ISS > 15 from January 2008 to June 2020. We compared the 24-h mortality of injured patients in circulatory shock undergoing WBCT with a control group undergoing standard workup only. Inclusion criteria were the simultaneous presence of a systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg, lactate > 2.2 mmol/l and base excess < - 2 mmol/l as surrogate markers for circulatory shock. To control for confounding, a propensity score matched analysis with conditional logistic regression for adjustment of residual confounders and a sensitivity analysis using inverse probability weighting (IPW) with and without adjustment were performed. Of the 3525 patients, 161 (4.6%) fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Of these, 132 (82%) underwent WBCT and 29 (18%) standard work-up only. In crude and matched analyses, no difference in early (24 h) mortality was observed (WBCT, 23 (17.4%) and no-WBCT, 8 (27.6%); p = 0.21). After matching and adjustment for main confounders, the odds ratio for the event of death at 24 h in the WBCT group was 0.36 (95% CI 0.07-1.73); p = 0.20. In the present study, WBCT did not increase the risk of death at 24 h among injured patients in shock. This adds to the growing data indicating that WBCT may be offered to trauma patients in circulatory shock without jeopardizing early survival."

"ABSTRACT","This case report details the challenging management of a 45-year-old male construction worker who suffered severe multiple injuries after a fall and subsequent collision with cement mixers. The patient presented with extensive injuries, including amputation, fractures and internal bleeding, leading to a state known as the ‘triangle of death’. Despite the initial grim prognosis, evidenced by an ISS score of 28 and a mortality risk coefficient of 89.56%, the patient was successfully resuscitated and managed through a multidisciplinary approach. This included damage control resuscitation, emergency vascular interventions and targeted temperature management for brain protection. The patient’s recovery highlights the effectiveness of comprehensive trauma management and the critical role of coordinated care in severe multi-trauma cases."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: Whole blood (WB) has recently gained increased popularity as an adjunct to the resuscitation of hemorrhaging civilian trauma patients. We aimed to assess outcomes of using WB as an adjunct to component therapy (CT) versus CT alone in resuscitating geriatric trauma patients. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 2017-2020 ACS-TQIP. We included geriatric (≥65years) trauma patients with SBP<90 and HR>120 who received ≥4U PRBC in ≤4 hours. Patients were stratified into WB-CT versus CT only. Primary outcomes were 6-hour, 24-hour, and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were survivor-only hospital LOS and major complications. Multivariable logistic regression Analyses were performed adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: 652 patients were identified, of which 59 received WB-CT (WB, 2 [1-2]; pRBC, 7 [4-12]; FFP, 3 [5-11]; platelets, 1 [1-2]) and 593 received CT only (pRBC, 6 [4-12]; FFP, 4 [2-9]; platelets, 0 [0-2]). The mean±SD age was 74 ± 7 years, and 85% had penetrating injuries. The median [IQR] ISS was 22 [13-34] in the WB-CT group and 23 [14-34] in the CT group. Overall, 6-hour, 24-hour, and in-hospital mortality were 15%, 21%, and 51%, respectively. 26% developed major complications, and the median LOS was 13 [5-26]. On regression analysis, WB was independently associated with reduced 6-hour (OR, 0.30 [0.09-0.96]; p=0.045),24-hour (OR, 0.22 [0.07-0.69]; p=0.009), and in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.53 [0.27-0.89]; p=0.015), but not with major complications (OR, 0.70 [0.34-1.47]; p=0.347) and survivor only hospital LOS (β+0.55 [-10to+11], p=0.918). Conclusion: Receipt of WB as an adjunct to CT is associated with improved early and overall mortality in geriatric trauma patients with severe hemorrhage. These findings are clinically important as this is an essential first step in prioritizing the selection of WB resuscitation for geriatric trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock."

"ABSTRACT","Background: Mechanism of injury (MOI) plays a significant role in a decision to perform whole-body computed tomography (CT) imaging for trauma patients. Various mechanisms have unique patterns of injury and therefore form an important variable in decision making. Methods: Retrospective cohort study including all patients >18 years old who received a whole-body CT scan between 1 January 2019 and 19 February 2020. The outcomes were divided into CT ‘positive’ if any internal injuries were detected and CT ‘negative’ if no internal injuries were detected. The MOI, vital sign parameters, and other relevant clinical examination findings at presentation were recorded. Results: 3920 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 1591 (40.6%) had a positive CT. The most common MOI was fall from standing height (FFSH), accounting for 23.0%, followed by motor vehicle accident (MVA), accounting for 22.4%. Covariates significantly associated with a positive CT included age, MVA >60 km/h, motor bike, bicycle, or pedestrian accident >30 km/h, prolonged extrication >30 min, fall from height above standing, penetrating chest or abdominal injury, as well as hypotension, neurological deficit, or hypoxia on arrival. FFSH was shown to reduce the risk of a positive CT overall, however, sub-analysis of FFSH in patients >65 years showed a significant association with a positive CT (OR 2.34, p < 0.001) compared to <65 years. Conclusions: Pre-arrival information including MOI and vital signs have significant impact on identifying subsequent injuries with CT imaging. In high energy trauma, we should consider the need for whole-body CT based on MOI alone regardless of the clinical examination findings. However, for low-energy trauma, including FFSH, in the absence of clinical examination findings which support an internal injury, a screening whole-body CT is unlikely to yield a positive result, particularly in the age group <65yo."

"ABSTRACT","The second update of the S3 guideline on the treatment of severely injured patients introduces new aspects regarding care. Trauma unit admission criteria have been updated according to the current state of knowledge in the literature. The accident mechanism as the sole criterion for trauma unit notification is no longer important. Geriatric patients with severe trauma also receive trauma unit care. A completely new chapter is “Stop the bleed (STB)—Prähospital”, which deals primarily with prehospital management. For imaging in the trauma unit, the extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (eFAST; abdominal focused assessment with sonography for trauma [FAST]+ thoracic sonography) has completely replaced FAST. The indication for whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) has also been introduced for patients in shock. Furthermore, criteria have been formulated to justify WBCT in trauma patients without impaired vital signs. In the new guideline, clearer indications are formulated, which in turn lead to more selective diagnostics."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: Pelvic fractures are a relatively rare occurrence in traumatized patients: their prevalence is about 3% of all the skeletal fractures and rises up to 25% in polytraumatized patients.1-2 However, their occurrence is characterized by a significant mortality rate, ranging from 10 to 50%0.3 In particular, fractures of the pelvic girdle with a pubic symphysis diastasis > 2-2,5 cm are associated with an increase of pelvic volume, thus facilitating the occurrence of life- threatening retroperitoneal haemorrhages.4-6. CT scan currently represents the gold standard for detection of pelvic fractures, however its use can be limited in particular situations, such as in haemodynamically unstable patients. X-ray has a low sensitivity (67%)5. US is routinely used in the primary survey in major trauma, however E- FAST cannot detect retroperitoneal haemorrhage. Objectives: The objective of the present study is to compare CT scan and US measurement of pubic symphysis (PS) diastasis, in order to determine whether sonography allows to perform an accurate early diagnosis of symphyseal diastasis in open book pelvic injuries. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, cohort study, performed on patients admitted to SpedaliCivili of Brescia, Ospedale Careggi of Florence and Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi of Varese between December 2020 and July 2022. Total body CT scan symphysis measurements were performed by a radiologist; US symphysis measurements (Fig 1) by an experienced operator who used predefined criteria. According to the local protocol, one centre did not report precise symphysis measurement but only recorded data as presence or absence of diastasis (2,5 cm cut-off). Results: A total of 208 patients were included in the study. In 102 only the presence or absence of diastasis (according to a cut-off of 2,5 cm) was measured, while in the remaining group complete assessment was available. US and CT scan detected PS widening in six patients (2,9%), while 198 (95%) were negative for diastasis after both tests. Discordant results were found in2 patients (0,9%): in the first case, US did not detect the diastasis but an experienced operator was not available. In the second one, US overestimated symphyseal diastasis, however the patient was haemodynamically unstable and underwent surgery for a diastasis of posterior sacroiliac joint. Using the Bland- Altman plot, we found an excellent agreement between the two diagnostic tests (r: 0.849, Fig. 2). Conclusions: US evaluation of pubic symphysis appears to be a rapid, reliable, bed-side method to allow early identification of symphyseal diastasis in open book injuries, which is associated with a high risk of haemorrhages. Our data suggest that US may overestimate the pubic symphysis measurements in comparison with CT scan, however this difference appears to be minimal below 5 cm of diastasis. This discordance is not relevant above 5 cm, since it does not affect the clinical management of patients. US evaluation can also be performed in prehospital settings, thus allowing a better management of the patients and their transfer to the most appropriate hospital and an alternative evaluation tool in hospitals where CT scan and X -ray are not immediately available.

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: The shared prehospital management of critically injured trauma patients assumes the presence of spinal injury until proven otherwise (1). However, there is growing evidence documenting harm and a delayed time to intervention associated with the use of rigid collar and spinal stabilization (2, 7), especially in trauma victims with hemodynamic or neurological instability (3, 4). In these patients, any prehospital procedure (spinal immobilization included) should never preclude or delay lifesaving interventions as it is proved that longer on-scene time is associated with increased mortality (5). Besides, there is no randomized trial showing superiority of usual spinal immobilization (cervical collars, long boards) over manual in line stabilization and recent literature is even highlighting several complications related to their use (increased intracranial pressure, reduced functional residual capacity, delay in airway management, pressure lesions) (6-8). Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of spinal injury in trauma patients with hemodynamic or neurological instability and to describe their median on-scene time and total prehospital time. Methods: Inclusion criteria were trauma patients admitted to the trauma centers of Lombardia, who underwent a total body CT scan and whose data were reported in Lombardia Trauma Registry (LTR). In this LTR registry-based retrospective cohort study, demographic data, level of prehospital care (advanced life support-ALS, basic life support-BLS), prehospital time, abbreviated injury score (AIS, 2015 version), injury severity score (ISS) of all trauma patients were retrospectively reviewed. Moreover, the prevalence of spinal injuries (AIS ≥ 3), their localization (cervical or thoracic) and the severity of spinal lesions (spinal cord injuries or unstable vertebral fractures or ligamentous injuries) were recorded. Conventionally, an ISS ≥ 16 was defined as major trauma (2). Prehospital hemodynamic and/or neurological instability was also detected. Hemodynamic instability (Hem-I) was defined as prehospital shock index (SI) > 1 or cardiac arrest, while neurological instability (Neu-I) was defined as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9 and pupilar signs of intracranial hypertension. Moreover, prehospital time (PHT), defined as time elapsed between BLS or ALS arrival on scene and the arrival at the hospital, and on-scene time (OST) was recorded. Data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Results: The cohort is based on 7334 patients, victims of major trauma, from January 2020 to December 2022 and included in LTR. Among the 361 patients (77.8% male, 53 ± 15 years old, overall mortality 1.4%) that suffered from post-traumatic spinal injury (SPI), 72 (19.9%) reported spinal cord injury (SCI) and 299 (82.8%) vertebral unstable injuries (VUI). Details of these lesions according to their location (cervical or thoracic), their prevalence in hemodynamic or neurological unstable patients, the median OST in each group, and the severity of trauma (defined by ISS) are summarized in Table 1. Median PHT for Hem-I and Neu-I patients was respectively 54 (42-70) and 54 (42-68) minutes while PHT in stable patients was 49 (38-68). Conclusions: The prevalence of SPI in Hem-I and Neu-I patients was respectively 12.1% and 8.3%; in these patients the median OST and total PHT was longer than recommended, especially in Neu-I patients with cervical injury (major head trauma). This result suggests that the goal of optimizing prehospital time in case of instability, especially in patients with early signs of intracranial hypertension, for most patients may be reached also by customizing immobilization protocols without an increased risk of spine lesion."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes a major health-concern globally. Gender-dependent differences in mortality outcome after TBI have been controversially discussed. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, matched-pair analysis using data collected by the TraumaRegister DGU(®) of the German Trauma Society between 2009 and 2020. All patients after severe trauma with the leading injury of TBI (AIS ≥ 3), above 18 years of age were included. Thereby, 42,034 cases were identified. We used 12 different matching criteria to ensure highly accurate matching and were able to match 11,738 pairs of one female and one male patient. Results: Average age at injury was 67.5 ± 19.6 years in women and 66.7 ± 19.1 years in men. Mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 21.3 ± 8.1 in women and 21.6 ± 8.2 in men. While women were more likely to die within the first week after trauma, the mortality was significantly higher in men overall (30.8 vs. 29.2%, p < 0.002). Women were less likely to suffer from multi organ failure (MOF) (27.5 vs. 33.0%) or sepsis (4.5 vs. 7.1%). When comparing younger (≤ 45-years) and older (> 45 years) patients, overall mortality was lower in men (13.1% men vs. 13.4% women) in the younger age group, but in the older group mortality was lower in women (33.8% men vs. 31.8% women). Discussion: Gender-specific differences in the clinical outcome of severely injured patients with leading TBI could be detected. While women are overall characterized by an advantage in survival, this feature is not equally reproducible in premenopausal women. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological reasons for the described survival advantages of women will have to be explored in further prospective clinical studies."

"ABSTRACT","Objective: Blunt traumatic aortic injury (BTAI) in severe trauma patients is rare but potentially lethal. The aim of this work was to perform a current epidemiological analysis of the clinical and surgical management of these patients in a European country. Methods: This was a multicentre, retrospective study using prospectively collected data from the French National Trauma Registry and the National Uniform Hospital Discharge Database from 10 trauma centres in France. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of BTAI. The secondary endpoints focused chronologically on injury characteristics, management, and patient outcomes. Results: 209 patients were included with a mean age of 43 ± 19 years and 168 (80%) were men. The calculated prevalence of BTAI at hospital admission was 1% (162/15 094) (BTAI admissions/all trauma). The time to diagnosis increased with the severity of aortic injury and the clinical severity of the patients (grade 1: 94 [74, 143] minutes to grade 4: 154 [112, 202] minutes, p =.020). This delay seemed to be associated with the intensity of the required resuscitation. Sixty seven patients (32%) received no surgical treatment. Among those treated, 130 (92%) received endovascular treatment, 14 (10%) open surgery (two were combined), and 123 (85%) were treated within the first 24 hours. Overall mortality was 20% and the attributed cause of death was haemorrhagic shock (69%). Mortality was increased according to aortic injury severity, from 6% for grade 1 to 65% for grade 4 (p <.001). Twenty-six (18.3%) patients treated by endovascular aortic repair had complications. Conclusion: BTAI prevalence at hospital admission was low but occurred in severe high velocity trauma patients and in those with a high clinical suspicion of severe haemorrhage. The association of shock with high grade aortic injury and increasing time to diagnosis suggests a need to optimise early resuscitation to minimise the time to treatment. Endovascular treatment has been established as the reference treatment, accounting for more than 90% of interventional treatment options for BTAI."

"ABSTRACT","Patients with a pelvic ring injury and hemodynamic instability can be challenging to manage with high rates of morbidity and mortality rates. Protocol-based resuscitation strategies are critical to successfully manage these potentially severely injured patients in a well-coordinated manner. While some aspects of treatment may vary slightly from institution to institution, it is critical to identify pelvic injuries and their associated injuries expediently. The first step at the scene of injury or in the trauma resuscitation bay should be the immediate application of a circumferential pelvic sheet or binder, initiation of physiologically optimal fluid resuscitation in the form 1:1:1 (pRBC:FFP:platelets) or whole blood, and to consider TXA as a safe adjunct to treat coagulopathy. Providers should have a very low threshold for emergent operative intervention in the form of pelvic external fixation and/or pelvic packing. This occurs in addition to simultaneous interventions addressing the other possible sources of bleeding in patients demonstrating signs of hemorrhagic shock and failure to respond to early resuscitation and external pelvic tamponade. Finally, while arterial injury is only present in a small percentage of patients with a pelvic ring injury, percutaneous vascular intervention with selective angiography and REBOA have been shown to be efficacious for patients with clinical indicators of arterial injury or who remain hemodynamically unstable despite external pelvic tamponade and packing to address venous bleeding. They should be performed when as early as possible for patients in true extremis limit further hemorrhage and allow resuscitation efforts to continue."

"ABSTRACT","Key Content: Trauma accounts for 10% of annual worldwide deaths, and 6–8% of all pregnancies will experience some form of trauma. Pregnancy is an independent predictor for mortality. Trauma services in the UK were reorganised in 2012. Since then, the odds of survival from major trauma have increased by 19% compared with 2008. Trauma has maternal complications (for example, haemorrhage, abruption and disseminated intravascular coagulation) and fetal complications (such as preterm birth, hypoxic brain injury and death). Clinicians should initiate aggressive fluid resuscitation and strongly consider the possibility of concealed blood loss. Emphasis should be placed on warmed blood products and tranexamic acid. Trauma imaging should not be delayed for fear of risk to the fetus; we must continue to reinforce the tenet that the mother’s health takes priority over the fetus in all decision making and the mother’s condition should be stable prior to the assessment of fetal wellbeing. Learning Objectives: To explore the structure of trauma services in the UK. To understand the principles of trauma management and important considerations in the pregnant patient. To appreciate the maternal and fetal outcomes associated with trauma."

"ABSTRACT","Background: Computed tomography (CT) has emerged as the diagnostic modality of choice in trauma patients. Recent studies suggest its use in hemodynamically unstable patients is safe and potentially lifesaving; however, the incidence of adverse events (AE) during the trauma CT scanning process remains unknown. Study Design: Over a 6-month period at a Level 1 trauma center, data on patients undergoing trauma CT (whole-body CT (WBCT) +/− additional CT studies) were prospectively collected. All patients requiring a trauma team activation (TTA) were included. Adverse events and specific time intervals were recorded from the time of TTA notification to the time of return to the resuscitation bay from the CT suite. Results: Of the 94 consecutive patients included in the study, 47.9% experienced 1 or more AE. Median duration away from the resuscitation bay for all patients was 24 minutes. Patients with AE spent a significantly longer time away from the resuscitation bay and had longer scan times. Vasopressor support and ongoing transfusion requirement at the time of CT scanning were associated with AE. Conclusion: Adverse events of varying clinical significance occur frequently in patients undergoing emergent trauma CT. A standard trauma CT protocol could improve the efficiency and safety of the scanning process."

"ABSTRACT","BACKGROUND Whole blood (WB) has shown promise in pediatric trauma resuscitation following its prominent role in the resuscitation of adult trauma patients. Although WB in children has been shown to be feasible, its effectiveness has yet to be explored. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of WB transfusion as an adjunct to component therapy (CT) compared with CT only as early resuscitation for pediatric trauma patients. METHODS Children aged 1 to 17 years, who were transfused within 4 hours of presentation, were identified in the Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017 database. Patients were stratified into those receiving WB-CT versus CT alone. Propensity score matching in a 1:2 ratio was performed based on patient demographics, injury characteristics, hemorrhage control interventions, and trauma center level. The primary outcome measure was patient transfusion requirement. Secondary outcome measures were mortality, hospital length of stay, ventilation days, and major complications. RESULTS A total of 135 children receiving WB-CT were matched to 270 patients receiving CT only. Mean (SD) age was 12 (5) years, 66% were male, and the median Injury Severity Score was 32 (range, 20-43). A total of 51% of patients were in shock, 34% had penetrating injuries, and 41% required surgical intervention for hemorrhage control. Total blood products transfused were significantly decreased in children receiving WB, both at 4 hours (35 [22-73] vs. 48 [33-95] mL/kg; p = 0.013) and 24 hours (39 [24-97] vs. 53 [36-119] mL/kg; p < 0.001). Mortality rate at 24 hours (19.3% vs. 21.9%; p = 0.546) and in-hospital mortality (31.1% vs. 34.4%; p = 0.502) were not different. Similarly, no difference in hospital length of stay and rates of major complications was found. Patients in the WB group required significantly less ventilation days (2 [2-6] vs. 3 [2-8] days; p = 0.021). CONCLUSION Using WB as an adjunct to CT was associated with decreased transfusion requirements and ventilation days in pediatric trauma patients."

"ABSTRACT","Trauma care in the UK is a rapidly developing subspecialty of multiple disciplines from pre-hospital care through to rehabilitation medicine. In its infancy, the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) approach was designed for a sole provider to critically assess and manage a multiply injured patient with life-threatening injuries through a systematic resuscitation. With the advent of modern trauma systems, major trauma centres and their trauma teams the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure approach (ABCDE) of ATLS often play out simultaneously, during which it is vital that the providers have a common understanding of each contributor's roll in the assessment and care of the patient. The 10th Edition of the ATLS Student Manual has an additional new section on Teamwork, reflecting the most up-to-date scientific knowledge on the importance of the team system in trauma resuscitation. ATLS is also one of the seven pillars of change which have been adopted by the Royal College of Surgeons England for reforming the trauma systems in the UK. This article focuses on the ATLS guidelines as the founding principle of good trauma care and incorporates discussion upon some other important modern concepts utilized in the care of the multiply injured patient."

"ABSTRACT","Brief SummaryUnrecognized abdominal and pelvic injuries can result in catastrophic disability and death. Sporadic reports of ""occult"" injuries have generated concern, and physicians, fearing that they may miss such an injury, have adopted the practice of obtaining computed tomography on virtually all patients with significant blunt trauma. This practice exposes large numbers patients to dangerous radiation at considerable expense, while detecting injuries in a small minority of cases. Existing data suggest that a limited number of criteria can reliably identify blunt injury victims who have ""no risk"" of abdominal or pelvic injuries, and hence no need for computed tomography (CT), without misidentifying any injured patient. It is estimated that nationwide implementation of such criteria could result in an annual reduction in radiographic charges of $75 million, and a significant decrease in radiation exposure and radiation induced malignancies. This study seeks to determine whether ""low risk"" criteria can reliably identify patients who have sustained significant abdominal or pelvic injuries and safely decrease CT imaging of blunt trauma patients. This goal will be accomplished in the following manner: All blunt trauma victims undergoing computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis in the emergency department will undergo routine clinical evaluations prior to radiographic imaging. Based on these examinations, the presence or absence of specific clinical findings (i.e. abdominal/pelvic/flank pain, abdominal/pelvic/flank tenderness, bruising abrasions, distention, hip pain, hematuria, hypotension, tachycardia, low or falling hematocrit, intoxication, altered sensorium, distracting injury, positive FAST imaging, dangerous mechanism, abnormal x-ray imaging) will be recorded for each patient, as will the presence or absence of abdominal or pelvic injuries. The clinical findings will serve as potential imaging criteria. At the completion of the derivation portion of the study the criteria will be examined to find a subset that predicts injury with high sensitivity, while simultaneously excluding injury, and hence the need for imaging, in the remaining patients. These criteria will then be confirmed in a separate validation phase of the study. The criteria will be considered to be reliable if the lower statistical confidence limit for the measured sensitivity exceeds 98.0%. Potential reductions in CT imaging will be estimated by determining the proportion of ""low-risk"" patients that do not have significant abdominal or pelvic injuries.Detailed DescriptionRESEARCH STRATEGY Significance Injuries to the abdomen and pelvis can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in adult blunt trauma patients. Clinicians, concerned about abdominal and pelvic injuries, have increasingly utilized abdominal-pelvic (A/P) CT imaging of blunt trauma patients. CT imaging is compelling because of its documented high sensitivity in detecting injuries, and has lead some to recommend ""pan-scan"" imaging, which includes head, neck, chest and A/P CT imaging, of all blunt trauma patients. However, well-designed comparative trials have repeatedly failed to demonstrate improved patient outcomes thorough the use of ""pan-scanning"". It is hard to justify routine imaging if there is no benefit, particularly since A/P CT imaging is expensive and exposes patients to ionizing radiation and risk of lethal malignant transformation. As a consequence, recent recommendations emphasize the use of selective imaging in assessing most trauma patients. At the present time, there are no definite recommendations to guide selective A/P CT imaging of blunt trauma patients. In current practice, imaging decisions are typically based on clinical judgment, which suffers from poor specificity and substantial variability, making it an imprecise and unreliable tool. A rigorously develop decision instrument could provide substantial benefit in guiding selective A/P CT imaging. A decrease in CT utilization by as little as 10% would translate to substantial, direct, long-term benefits. There were approximately 1.5 million blunt trauma activation visits at the 1,632 adult trauma centers in the United States in 2015. Nearly half of these patients underwent abdominal-pelvic CT imaging, implying that nation-wide approximately 750,000 blunt trauma patients undergo A/P CT imaging each year. If a decision instrument could allow clinicians to safely forego at least 10% of these CTs, up to 75,000 CTs could be eliminated annually in the U.S. This reduction would provide cost and resource savings, reduced radiation exposure and iatrogenic cancers in the young vulnerable trauma population, and facilitate more efficient trauma evaluations, translating to shorter ED length of stay. Approach Investigators will employ the classic design strategy described by Stiell in developing the decision instrument. The development process includes separate derivation and validation phases. The clinical criteria identified in the derivation phase will form the basis of the instrument, with ""high-risk"" classification assigned to patients exhibiting one or more of the criteria, and ""low-risk"" classification assigned to patients who exhibit none of the criteria. Investigators will then conduct a separate validation assessment to determine whether the instrument retains optimal performance among a new cohort of patients. The validation phase will focus on ensuring that the final instrument has the high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) needed to ensure its safe application, while retaining the highest possible specificity (and potential to decrease imaging). The primary goal of the study will be to develop an instrument that reliably identifies patients who have injuries of major clinical significance that are evident on A/P CT imaging. The injuries of interest in this goal include injuries that require intervention, as well as any injuries to the aorta (including those not requiring intervention), and select injuries to the spine. The secondary goal of the study will be to develop a tool that reliably identifies patients who have injuries of major or minor clinical significance. The injuries of interest related to this goal include injuries that require intervention, injuries that merit clinical observation, any injuries to the aorta, and select injuries to the spine. To be clinically reliable, the DI must exhibit a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 98% or greater. At this level of precision, the risk of unfavorable outcomes due to missed injuries is equivalent to the risk of lethal malignant transformation from the radiation exposure associated with increased imaging. Validating a 95% lower confidence bound of 98.0% for a measured NPV of 100.0% requires evaluations on 183 patients assigned ""low risk"" status by the instrument. Similar validation of the sensitivity requires evaluations on 183 patients who have sustained injuries of major clinical significance. Because ""low risk"" patients are more prevalent than those sustaining major injuries, the ultimate sample estimate is driven by the need to enroll 183 patients who have sustained major A/P injuries. Protocol Phase I - Derivation Clinicians will assess the presence or absence of each of the candidate criteria for each imaged patient during their initial emergency department evaluation. These assessments will be recorded prior to initiating CT imaging. The injury status of each patient will be based on final radiologic interpretation of the initial A/P CT imaging obtained in the ED. Investigators require that relevant injuries be evident on CT imaging because the risk classification assigned by the instrument is immaterial if an injury is not visible on CT imaging. Injuries will be further classified as being of major, minor, or insignificant concern based on review of the patients care during their index visit. The three level injury classification reflects the fact that many clinicians are comfortable in missing minor injuries provided that all injuries requiring intervention are identified, while other clinicians are uncomfortable using tools that occasionally miss minor injuries that require no intervention, and seek to identify all injuries regardless of their clinical significance. To accommodate these perspectives, investigators will employ identical techniques to develop a two separate decision instruments. The first, and primary goal of the study, is to develop an instrument that identifies all injuries requiring intervention, while a second goal is to create an instrument that identifies all significant injuries, whether they require intervention or not. Investigators will employ binary recursive partitioning to derive the decision instruments. The primary instrument must exhibit a sensitivity and negative predictive value greater than 98.0% in detecting and excluding major injuries. The second instrument must exhibit similar sensitivity and NPV in detecting and excluding major and minor injuries. Phase II - Validation In the second phase of the study, investigators will apply the instruments to a new cohort of blunt trauma patients to assess their performance and determine whether they retain sufficient sensitivity to support their use as A/P CT decision tools. Clinicians will again document the presence or absence of criteria during their initial emergency department evaluations, and record their impressions prior to imaging. Investigators will base the presence or absence of injury on the final radiologic interpretation of the initial A/P CT imaging obtained in the ED. Injuries will be further classified as being of major, minor, or insignificant concern based on review of the patients care during their index visit. The primary outcome will be the sensitivity of the instrument in classifying as ""high-risk"" all patients harboring injuries of major importance. Investigators will also calculate the NPV, specificity, and count the number of ""low-risk"" patients for whom imaging might have been safely omitted had the decision instrument been implemented. The secondary outcome will be to perform a similar analysis focused on identifying patients with injuries major or minor clinical significance, and will measure the sensitivity, NPV, specificity, and potential to reduce imaging using this additional version of the instrument. Data Collection Criteria assessments. Physicians will assess the status of the individual criteria during their initial emergency department evaluations and prior to ordering CT imaging. Investigators will record demographic information for each patient, along with the clinician assessments of the presence or absence of potential predictor variables. The potential predictor variables include abdominal pain or tenderness, flank pain or tenderness, pelvic pain or tenderness, hip or iliac pain or tenderness, midline lumbar spine or sacral pain, abnormal alertness, evidence of intoxication, distracting painful injury, and hypotension. Investigators will also record historical information and emergency department vital signs measurements. Data collection during the validation phase will follow a similar process, but will be limited to demographic information and the criteria that compose the decision instruments. Patient outcomes. The presence of significant major or minor injuries will be based on final radiologic interpretation of the initial CT imaging obtained in the ED. The classification into major or minor status will be based on review of the patients care during their index visit to determine whether the patient underwent any interventional procedures. All injury assessments will be completed by trained investigators blinded to criteria assessments and final classification by the decision instrument. Investigators require that relevant injuries for the study must be evident on CT imaging because risk classification assigned by the instrument is immaterial if an injury is not visible on CT imaging. Injuries of major clinical significance consist of all abdominal and pelvic injuries requiring intervention, as well as any injury to the aorta, and any injury to the spine involving instability or neurological compromise. Injuries that require only observation, but no intervention, will be considered clinically minor, provided they do not involve the aorta or spine, while injuries that required neither intervention nor observation, and that do not involve the aorta or spine will be considered insignificant. Formulation of the optimal A/P CT decision instrument. Investigators will treat each individual criterion as a dichotomous variable. For analytic purposes in the derivation phase, each variable will be considered negative (normal) unless it can be assessed and found to be abnormal. Thus, variables that cannot be measured in an individual patient (such as coagulopathy in an unconscious individual) will be documented as ""unable to assess"" and treated statistically as negative. This will ensure that the derivation process is based on observed assessments and is as robust as possible. Investigators will use the individual criteria to construct the nodal points of the recursive partitions. Investigators will employ binary recursive partitioning to identify a combination of candidate criteria that predicts significant abdominal-pelvic injuries with \> 98.0% sensitivity, excludes significant injuries with \> 98.0% NPV, and retains the greatest specificity. Sensitivity will be used as the outcome measure for constructing the partitions. Investigators will terminate the partitioning under the following circumstances: 1) partitioning produces an instrument exhibiting a sensitivity of 100.0%, 2) partitioning exhausts all patients without developing a sufficiently sensitive rule, 3) partitioning exhausts all variables (criteria) without identifying a sufficiently sensitive rule. Circumstance I will confirm the hypothesis driving the first specific aim. Circumstance 2 and 3 may confirm the first hypothesis, provided the lower confidence limit of for the sensitivity of the resultant rule exceeds 98.0%, otherwise these circumstances will be interpreted to refute the first hypothesis. Investigators will create two distinct decision instruments. The first, and primary instrument will focus on identifying only those patients having injuries of major clinical significance. Investigators will also develop a second instrument that identifies patients having injuries of either major or minor significance. Validation of the A/P CT decision instrument. The validation phase will again treat each individual criterion as a dichotomous variable. Each variable will be considered negative (normal) only if it is assessed and found to be normal. Variables that cannot be measured in an individual patient (i.e. coagulopathy in an unconscious individual) will be documented as ""un-assessable"" and treated statistically as positive. This ensures that patients will be assigned low-risk status only if all criteria are adequately assessed and found to be negative. Patients will be excluded from low-risk classification (and assigned high-risk status) if they have one or more positive or un-assessed criteria. This requirement ensures patients are not assigned low-risk status on the basis of an inadequate assessment. Using the final risk assignments and patient outcomes, investigators will assign each case to one of the following four categories: 1 - true-positive status (injured patients classified as ""high-risk"" by the DI); 2 - false-negative status (injured patients classified as ""low-risk"" by the DI); 3 - false-positive status (uninjured patients classified as ""high-risk"" by the DI); and 4 - true-negative status (uninjured patients classified as ""low-risk"" by the DI). Investigators will employ these values to calculate point measures and 95 percent confidence intervals for sensitivity, NPV and specificity of the decision instrument. Investigators will consider the instrument to be validated if the lower 95% confidence interval for its measured sensitivity exceeds 98.0%. Assessing the potential to decrease A/P CT imaging. Investigators must assess whether application of the tool to blunt trauma patients actually has the potential to decrease A/P CT imaging. Because of the tool's inherent sensitivity, ""low risk"" patients will be free of injury and receive no benefit from imaging. They are ideal candidates to exclude from imaging. Thus, measuring the proportion of ""low-risk"" patients will provide the investigators with an estimate of potential imaging reductions. Reductions in charges and radiation exposure will be determined by respectively summing radiographic charges and life-time decreases in radiation morbidity and mortality for all ""no risk"" cases."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: Major trauma is the leading cause of mortality in the world in patients younger than 40 years. However, the proportion of elderly people who suffer trauma has increased significantly. The purpose of this study is to assess the correlation of old age with mortality and other unfavorable outcomes. Methods: We assessed on one hand, anatomical criteria such as ISS values and the number of body regions affected, on the other hand, hemodynamic instability criteria, various shock indices, and Glasgow Coma Scale. Finally, we also evaluated biochemical parameters, such as lactate, BE, and pH values. We conducted a prospective and monocentric observational study of all the patients referred to the Emergency Department of the IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico S. Matteo in Pavia for major trauma in 13 consecutive months: January 1, 2018-January 30, 2019. We compared the elderly population (>75 years) and the younger population (≤75). Results: We included 501 patients, among which 10% were over the age of 75 years. The mortality rate was higher among the older patients than among the younger (4% vs. 1.33%; P = 0.050). Hemodynamic instability was more common in the older patients than in the younger (26% vs. 9%; P < 0.001). More older patients (44%) had an ISS >16, in comparison with 32% of younger patients (P = 0.01). Conclusions: The elderly showed worse outcomes in terms of mortality, hospitalization rate, hemodynamic instability criteria, and anatomical and biochemical parameters."

"ABSTRACT","Haemorrhagic shock is the most common preventable cause of early mortality in polytrauma patients. Road traffic injuries are the most common cause for polytrauma and most commonly include orthopaedic injuries. Hence, orthopaedic trainees and junior orthopaedic surgeons need to be well aware of evaluation and management of haemorrhagic shock in the multiple injured patient. The present narrative review discusses evaluation and current principles in management of haemorrhagic shock in a polytrauma patient. A classification system for haemorrhagic shock based on ATLS guidelines has been described along with novel use of colour coding to facilitate better and effective use of the classification. A treatment algorithm has also been presented for quick reference. The emphasis is to avoid overloading with crystalloid fluids, replacing with blood and blood products (Balanced resuscitation), permissive hypotension, prevent and acutely treat lethal conditions such as hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy. The management of haemorrhagic shock in polytrauma patient is quite challenging and require a detailed knowledge of its management. An arbitrary and haphazard management of these patients may lead to severe complications. We have mentioned the broad principles of management of hypovolemic shock in a polytrauma patient."

"ABSTRACT","Injury-related morbidity and mortality have been one of the most common causes of loss in productivity across all geographic distributions. It remains to be a global concern despite a continual improvement in regional and national safety policies. The establishment of trauma care systems and advancements in diagnostics and management have improved the overall survival of severely injured. A better understanding of the physiopathological and immunological responses to injury led to a significant shift in trauma care from “Early Total Care” to “Damage Control Orthopedics.” While most of these algorithms were tailored to the philosophy of “life before limb,” the impact of improper fracture management on disability and societal loss is increasingly being recognized. Recently, “Early Appropriate Care” of extremities has gained importance; however, its implementation is influenced by regional health care policies, available resources, and expertise and varies between low and high-income countries. A review of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases on articles published from 1990 to 2020 using the Mesh terms “Polytrauma,” “Multiple Trauma,” and “Fractures.” This review aims to consolidate on guidelines and available evidence in the management of extremity injuries in a polytraumatized patient to achieve better clinical outcomes of these severely injured."

"ABSTRACT","INTRODUCTION Renewed interest in whole blood (WB) resuscitation in civilians has emerged following its military use. There is a paucity of data on its role in civilians where balanced component therapy (CT) resuscitation is the standard of care. The aim of this study was to assess nationwide outcomes of using WB as an adjunct to CT versus CT alone in resuscitating civilian trauma patients. METHODS We analyzed the (2015-2016) Trauma Quality Improvement Program. We included adult (age, ≥18 years) trauma patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock and requiring at least 1 U of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) within 4 hours. Patients were stratified into WB-CT versus CT only. Primary outcomes were 24-hour and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and major complications. Hierarchical logistic regression was performed to account for clustering effect within hospitals and adjusting for patient- and hospital-level potential confounding factors. RESULTS A total of 8,494 patients were identified, of which 280 received WB-CT (WB, 1 [1-1] pRBC, 16 [10-23] FFP, 9 [6-16] platelets, 3 [2-5]) and 8,214 received CT only (pRBC, 15 [10-24] FFP, 10 [6-16] platelets, 2 [1-4]). Mean ± SD age was 34 ± 16 years, 79% were male, Injury Severity Score was 33 (24-43), and 63% had penetrating injuries. Patients who received WB-CT had a lower 24-hour mortality (17% vs. 25%; p = 0.002), in-hospital mortality (29% vs. 40%; p < 0.001), major complications (29% vs. 41%; p < 0.001), and a shorter length of stay (9 [7-12] vs. 15 [10-21] p = 0.011). On regression analysis, WB was independently associated with reduced 24-hour mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.78 [0.59-0.89] p = 0.006), in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.88 [0.81-0.90] p = 0.011), and major complications (OR, 0.92 [0.87-0.96] p = 0.013). CONCLUSION The use of WB as an adjunct to CT is associated with improved outcomes in resuscitation of severely injured civilian trauma patients. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of adding WB to massive transfusion protocols. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic, level IV."

"ABSTRACT","BACKGROUND: The TraumaRegister DGU® (TR-DGU) of the German Trauma Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie, DGU) enables the participating hospitals to perform quality management. For that purpose, nine so-called audit filters have existed, since its foundation, which, inter alia, is listed in the Annual Report. The objective of this study effort is a revision of these quality indicators with the aim of developing pertinent new and reliable quality indicators for the management of severely injured patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apart from indicators already used at national and international levels, a systematic review of the literature revealed further potential key figures for quality of the management of severely injured patients. The latter were evaluated by an interdisciplinary and interprofessional group of experts using a standardized QUALIFY process to assess their suitability as a quality indicator. RESULTS: By means of the review of the literature, 39 potential indicators could be identified. 9 and 14 indicators, respectively, were identified in existing trauma registries (TR-DGU and TARN), 17 in the ATLS® training concept, and 57 in the S3 guideline on the treatment of polytrauma/severe injuries. The exclusion of duplicates and the limitation to indicators that can be collected using the TR-DGU Version 2015 data set resulted in a total of 43 indicators to be reviewed. For each of the 43 indicators, 13 quality criteria were assessed. A consensus was achieved in 305 out of 559 individual assessments. With 13 quality criteria assessed and 43 indicators correspond this to a relative consensus value of 54.6%. None of the indicators achieved a consensus in all 13 quality criteria assessed. The following 13 indicators achieved a consensus in at least 9 quality criteria: time between hospital admission and WBCT, mortality, administration of tranexamic acid to bleeding patients, use of CCT with GCS > 14, time until first emergency surgical intervention (7-item list in the TR-DGU), time until surgical intervention for penetrating trauma, application of pelvic sling belt (prehospital), capnometry (etCO2) in intubated patients, time until CCT with GCS < 15, time until surgery for hemorrhagic shock, time until craniotomy for severe TBI, prehospital airway management in unconscious patients (GCS < 9), and complete basic diagnostics available. Two indicators achieved a consensus in 11 criteria and thus represent the maximum consensus achieved within the group of experts. Four indicators only achieved a consensus in three quality criteria. 17 indicators had a mean value for the 3 relevance criteria of ≥ 3.5 and were, therefore, assessed by the group of experts as being highly relevant. CONCLUSION: Not all the key figures published for the management of severely injured patients are suitable for use as quality indicators. It remains to be seen whether the quality indicators identified by experts using the QUALIFY process will meet the requirements in practice. Prior to the implementation of the assessed quality indicators in standardized quality assurance programs, a scientific evaluation based on national data will be required."

"ABSTRACT","This review assesses the appropriateness of various imaging studies for adult major blunt trauma or polytrauma in the acute setting. Trauma is the leading cause of mortality for people in the United States <45 years of age, and the fourth leading cause of death overall. Imaging, in particular CT, plays a critical role in the management of these patients, and a number of indications are discussed in this publication, including patients who are hemodynamically stable or unstable; patients with additional injuries to the face, extremities, chest, bowel, or urinary system; and pregnant patients. Excluded from consideration in this review are penetrating traumatic injuries, burns, and injuries to pediatric patients. Patients with suspected injury to the head and spine are also discussed more specifically in other appropriateness criteria documents. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment."

"ABSTRACT","BACKGROUND Timely angioembolization (AE) is known to improve outcomes of patients with hemorrhage resulting from pelvic fracture. The hybrid emergency room system (HERS) is a novel trauma resuscitation room equipped with a computed tomography scanner, fluoroscopy equipment, and an operating room setup. We hypothesized that the HERS would improve the timeliness of AE for pelvic fracture. METHODS A retrospective medical record review of patients who underwent AE for pelvic fracture at our institution from April 2015 to December 2018 was conducted. Patients' demographics, location of AE, Injury Severity Score, Revised Trauma Score, probability of survival by the trauma and injury severity score (TRISS Ps) method, presence of interventional radiologists (IRs) upon patient arrival, time from arrival to AE, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. These data were compared between patients who underwent AE in the HERS (HERS group) and in the regular angio suite (non-HERS group). RESULTS Ninety-six patients met the inclusion criteria. The HERS group comprised 24 patients, and the non-HERS group, 72 patients. Interventional radiologists were more frequently present upon patient arrival in the HERS than non-HERS group (IRs, 79% vs. 22%, p < 0.01). The time from arrival to AE was shorter in the HERS than non-HERS group (median [range], 46 [5-75] minutes vs. 103 [2-690] minutes, p < 0.01). There were no differences in the rate of in-hospital mortality (13% vs. 15%, p = 0.52) between the two groups. Survivors in the HERS group had a lower probability of survival by the trauma and injury severity score (median [range], 61% [1%-98%] vs. 93% [1%-99%], p < 0.01) than survivors in the non-HERS group. CONCLUSION The HERS improved the timeliness of AE for pelvic fracture. More severely injured patients were able to survive in the HERS. The new team building involving the addition of IRs to the traditional trauma resuscitation team will enhance the benefit of the HERS."

"ABSTRACT","Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a new single-pass wholebody computed tomography Protocol in the management of patients with severe trauma. Methods: This was a descriptive evaluation of polytrauma patients who underwent whole-body computed tomography. Patients were divided into three groups: 1. Blunt trauma hemodynamically stable 2. Blunt trauma hemodynamically unstable and 3. Penetrating trauma. Demographics, wholebody computed tomography parameters and outcome variables were evaluated. Results: Were included 263 patients. Median injury severity score was 22 (IQR: 16-22). Time between arrival to the emergency department and completing the whole-body computed tomography was under 30 minutes in most patients [Group 1: 28 minutes (IQR: 14-55), Group 2: 29 minutes (IQR: 16-57), and Group 3: 31 minutes (IQR: 13-50; p= 0.96)]. 172 patients (65.4%) underwent nonoperative management. The calculated and the real survival rates did not vary among the groups either [Group 1: TRISS 86.4% vs. real survival rate 85% (p= 0.69); Group 2: TRISS 69% vs. real survival rate 74% (p= 0.25); Group 3: TRISS 93% vs. real survival rate 87% (p= 0.07)]. Conclusion: This new single-pass whole-body computed tomography protocol was safe, effective and efficient to decide whether the patient with severe trauma requires a surgical intervention independently of the mechanism of injury or the hemodynamic stability of the patient. Its use could also potentially reduce the rate of unnecessary surgical interventions of patients with severe trauma including those with penetrating trauma."

"ABSTRACT","Trauma is a complex pathology that requires an experienced multidisciplinary team with an inherent quick decision-making capacity, given that a few minutes could rep-resent a matter of life or death. These management decisions not only need to be quick but also accurate to be able to prioritize and to efficiently control the injuries that may be causing impending hemodynamic collapse. In essence, this is the cor-nerstone of the concept of damage control trauma care. With current technological advances, physicians have at their disposition multiple diagnostic imaging tools that can aid in this prompt decision-making algorithm. This manuscript aims to perform a literature review on this subject and to share the experience on the use of whole body computed tomography as a potentially safe, effective and efficient diagnostic tool in cases of severely injured trauma patients regardless of their hemodynamic status. Our general recommendation is that, when feasible, perform a whole body computed tomography without interrupting ongoing hemostatic resuscitation in cases of severely injured trauma patients with or without signs of hemodynamic instability. The use of this technology will aid in the decision-making of the best surgical approach for these patients without incurring any delay in definitive management and/or increasing significantly their radiation exposure."

"ABSTRACT","Background: We report a case study of fat embolism seen on ultrasound at right internal jugular vein during central venous cannulation in a patient diagnosed with fat embolism syndrome. This case demonstrates the importance of ultrasound for evaluation of trauma cases with suspicion of fat embolism. Case presentation: A 23-year-old trauma patient with closed fracture of left femoral shaft and left humerus presented to our emergency department (ED). 11 h after admission to ED, patient became confused, hypoxic and hypotensive. He was then intubated for respiratory failure and mechanically ventilated. Transesophageal ultrasound revealed hyperdynamic heart, dilated right ventricle with no regional wall abnormalities and no major aorta injuries. Whole-body computed tomography was normal. During central venous cannulation of right internal jugular vein (IJV), we found free floating mobile hyperechoic spots, located at the anterior part of the vein. A diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome later was made based on the clinical presentation of long bone fractures and fat globulin in the blood. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, patient was a non-responder and needed vasopressor infusion for persistent shock. Blood aspirated during cannulation from the IJV revealed a fat globule. Patient underwent uneventful orthopedic procedures and was discharged well on day 5 of admission. Conclusions: Point-of-care ultrasound findings of fat embolism in central vein can facilitate and increase the suspicion of fat embolism syndrome."

"ABSTRACT","Objectives: Whole body computed tomography (WBCT) scanning for trauma has gained popularity but its role in low-risk patients is controversial. We aimed to determine the rate of serious axial/truncal injury and emergency intervention in conscious, stable patients undergoing WBCT for blunt trauma in two non-trauma centre EDs in the Victorian trauma system. Methods: Retrospective cohort study by medical record and radiology report review. Patients were included if they were conscious, haemodynamically stable adults presenting by ambulance and having WBCT scan. Exclusion criteria were age <16 years, no history of trauma, Glasgow Coma Scale <14, systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and intoxication with alcohol or drugs. Data collected included demographics, clinical findings, results of CT scans and emergency interventions (emergency truncal surgery, transfer to a trauma centre and/or transfusion within 24 h). The outcomes of interest were the rate of defined serious axial/truncal injury and emergency interventions. Results: One hundred and four patients were studied. Median age was 45 years; 67% were men. Median injury severity score (ISS) was 1.5 (interquartile range 0–5); only one patient had an ISS ≥15. Ninety (87%, 78–92%) patients had no defined serious injury. Five (5%) patients had a defined emergency intervention – four trauma centre transfers and one transfusion. Two of these were not trauma-related. Conclusion: The rate of serious axial/truncal injury was low. The high rate of normal scans makes it likely that the risk:benefit ratio between injury identification and radiation related cancer risk is unacceptably high. This data supports a selective CT strategy in low-risk trauma patients."

"ABSTRACT","Background: Atlanto-occipital dislocation is a rare and severe injury of the upper spine associated with a very poor prognosis. Case presentation: We report the case of a 59-year-old European man who suffered from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest following a motor vehicle accident. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately by bystanders and continued by emergency medical services. After 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a total of five shocks following initial ventricular fibrillation, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved. An electrocardiogram recorded after return of spontaneous circulation at the scene showed signs of myocardial ischemia as a possible cause for the cardiac arrest. No visible signs of injury were found. He was transferred to the regional academic trauma center. Following an extended diagnostic and therapeutic workup in the emergency room, including extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma ultrasound, whole-body computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (of his head and neck), a diagnosis of major trauma (atlanto-occipital dislocation, bilateral serial rip fractures and pneumothoraces, several severe intracranial bleedings, and other injuries) was made. An unfavorable outcome was initially expected due to suspected tetraplegia and his inability to breathe following atlanto-occipital dislocation. Contrary to initial prognostication, after 22 days of intensive care treatment and four surgical interventions (halo fixation, tracheostomy, intracranial pressure probe, chest drains) he was awake and oriented, spontaneously breathing, and moving his arms and legs. Six weeks after the event he was able to walk without aid. After 2 months of clinical treatment he was able to manage all the activities of daily life on his own. It remains unclear, whether cardiac arrest due to a cardiac cause resulted in complete atony of the paravertebral muscles and caused this extremely severe lesion (atlanto-occipital dislocation) or whether cardiac arrest was caused by apnea due the paraplegia following the spinal injury of the trauma. Conclusions: A plausible cause for the trauma was myocardial infarction which led to the car accident and the major trauma in relation to the obviously minor trauma mechanism. With this case report we aim to familiarize clinicians with the mechanism of injury that will assist in the diagnosis of atlanto-occipital dislocation. Furthermore, we seek to emphasize that patients presenting with electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia after high-energy trauma should primarily be transported to a trauma facility in a percutaneous coronary intervention-capable center rather than the catheterization laboratory directly."

"ABSTRACT","Background: Penetrating trauma is rarely encountered in Nordic trauma centers, yet the incidence is increasing. Typical imaging findings in penetrating trauma should thus be familiar to all radiologists. Purpose: To evaluate incidence and imaging findings of penetrating chest trauma, gunshot wound (GSW) and stab wound (SW) injury spectrum, imaging protocols, and outcome in a large trauma center. Material and Methods: Trauma registry data from 2013–2016 was retrieved, and imaging accessed through hospital PACS. Retrieved variables included age, gender, injury severity scores, mechanism of injury, time to CT, and 30-day mortality. Depth of thoracic, pulmonary, abdominal and skeletal injury, active bleeding, and use of chest tubes were evaluated. Results: Of 636 patients with penetrating injuries, 443 (69.7%) underwent imaging. Of these, 161 (36.3%) had penetrating thoracic injuries. Of 161 patients with penetrating chest trauma in imaging, 151 (93.8%) were men (mean age = 34.9 years) and 10 (6.2%) were women (mean age = 40.7 years). The majority of patients had SWs (138 SW vs. 15 GSW). Patients with GSWs were more severely injured (mean ISS 17.00 vs. 8.84 [P=0.0014] and ISS≥16 in 53.3% vs. 16.7%) than SW patients. In CT, intrathoracic injuries were found in 49.4% (77/156) and active bleeding in 26.3% (41/156). Emergency surgery was performed in 6.2% (10/161) with postoperative CT imaging. Thirty-day mortality rate was 1.2% (2/161). Conclusion: Penetrating thoracic trauma often violates intrathoracic structures and nearby compartments. Arterial phase whole-body CT is recommended as multiple injuries and active bleeding are common. CT after emergency surgery is warranted, especially to assess injuries outside the surgical field."

"ABSTRACT","Learning Objectives: Children frequently receive whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) as evidence-based trauma care from studies of adults because pediatrics studies was scarce. Our aim was to investigate whether WBCT is associated with reduction of mortality compared to those receiving selective CT among children with blunt trauma. Methods: This study was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using Japan trauma data bank which was a nationwide trauma registry from tertiary emergency medical centers in Japan. We enrolled pediatric trauma patients aged < 16 years who received either WBCT or selective CT from 2004 to 2014. Exclusion criteria included patients with pre-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and non-blunt trauma such as penetrating injury, burns, or unknown trauma mechanisms. Patients were classified as receiving WBCT if they received head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scans; selective CT was defined as having at least one, but not all, of the above scans. Results: 9,170 patients were eligible for analysis. Median age was 9 (6-12) years and 69% were male. 38% received WBCT. In-hospital mortality of children who received WBCT and selective CT was 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively. Children who received WBCT demonstrated no significant difference in in-hospital mortality compared with those who received selective CT after adjusted age, gender, cause of injury, transport type, prehospital treatments, presence of altered mental status, and hypotension at ED presentation by multilevel logistic regressions models or propensity score matching (SPM) models. The adjusted odds ratio (WBCT vs selective CT) for in-hospital mortality was 1.05 (95%CI .70-1.56) in the multilevel logistic regression model 1, .72 (95%CI .44 -1.17) in the multilevel logistic regression model 2, .98 (95%CI .65 -1.47) in the PSM model 1, and, .71 (95%CI .46 -1.08) in the PSM model 2. Subgroup analyses also revealed no significant differences between CT selection and in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Trauma among children was associated with high frequency use of WBCT in Japan although it was less severe. WBCT was not associated with reduction of in-hospital mortality compared with selective CT among children with blunt trauma. Selective use of imaging may result in less radiation exposure and may be more beneficial in care of pediatric trauma patients."

"ABSTRACT","PURPOSE: The initial assessment of severely injured patients in the resuscitation room requires a systematic and quickly performed survey. Whereas the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS®)-based algorithm recommends focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) among others, recent studies report a survival advantage of early whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) in haemodynamically stable as well as unstable patients. This study assessed the opinions of trauma surgeons about the early use of WBCT in severely injured patients with abdominal trauma, and abdominal CT in patients with isolated abdominal trauma, during resuscitation room treatment.METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was performed over 8 months. Members of the Swiss Society for Surgery and the Austrian and German associations for trauma surgery were invited to answer nine online questions.RESULTS: Overall, 175 trauma surgeons from 155 departments participated. For haemodynamically stable patients, most considered FAST (77.6%) and early CT (82.3%) to be the ideal diagnostic tools. For haemodynamically unstable patients, 93.4% considered FAST to be mandatory. For CT imaging in unstable patients, 47.5% agreed with the use of CT, whereas 52.5% rated early CT as not essential. For unstable patients with pathological FAST and clinical signs, 86.8% agreed to proceed with immediate laparotomy.CONCLUSIONS: Most surgeons rely on early CT for haemodynamically stable patients with abdominal trauma, whereas FAST is performed with similar frequency and is prioritized in unstable patients. It seems that the results of recent studies supporting early WBCT have not yet found broad acceptance in the surgical community."

"ABSTRACT","We present a rare case of traumatic bilateral asymmetric hip dislocation with pelvic fractures and a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. A 53-year-old machinist was transferred to our emergency department with the suspicion of a bilateral hip dislocation after he was trapped between an elevator and the roof. Immediate closed reduction of the hips was not performed because of the expected risk of increasing hemodynamic instability with muscular relaxation. An emergent full-body computed tomography (CT) scan was made to assess injuries with need for further operative treatment. Thus, closed reduction of both hips was finally performed in the OR directly before the laparotomy for the diaphragmatic repair and the osteosynthesis of the anterior pelvic ring. A 12-month follow-up showed good general health condition with asymptomatic situation of the hip joints and the abdomen. The diagnostic work-up of patients with severe trauma is still debated, a randomized controlled trial showed no reduction of the in-hospital mortality with immediate full-body CT scan compared to a conventional radiological work-up. Traumatic hip dislocations (THDs) are always due to high-energy trauma and additional injuries are frequent. To attempt a closed reduction of THD, under general anesthesia can be life-threatening with unrecognized associated injuries. Therefore, THD can serve as selection criteria for immediate full-body CT scan to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of associated injuries sustained by the patient."

Early diagnosis and treatment can be lifesavers for this patient group in the emergency departments, which serve as the first place to admit trauma patients in a hospital. Objectives: We aim to determine high-risk criteria to indicate trauma patients getting the most use from whole-body tomography in patients with multiple traumas and reduce unnecessary computed tomography. Methods: We examined retrospectively all electronic files and computed tomography results of patients, who had been admitted to emergency department due to trauma, and who had undergone whole-body computed tomography. Results: We found that possibility of multiple injuries increased by 5.9 times in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Possibility of multiple injuries in patients with free fluid in the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma increased by 5.6 times. We also observed that possibility of multiple injuries in patients with Glasgow Coma Score < 13 increased by 4.3 times. Possibility of multiple injuries in hypoxic patients increased by 3.2 times. Possibility of multiple injuries in patients with a pulse ≥ 120/min increased by 1.8 times. Possibility of multiple injuries in patients with shock index ≥ 0.9 increased by 1.7 times. Conclusion: High-risk group in terms of multiple traumas involves mechanical ventilation need in trauma patients, positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma, Glasgow Coma Score being under 13, hypoxia, tachycardia, positive shock index, and extravehicular traffic accidents. Whole-body computed tomography should be performed in this patient group."

"ABSTRACT","Emergent exploratory laparotomy is recommended for hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patients suspected of having hemoperitoneum. However, given the unreliability of ultrasonography and rapid scan speed of computed tomography (CT), CT might help clinicians provide accurate information even in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients. This observational study aimed to describe the bleeding site and hospital course of severe blunt trauma patients with hemoperitoneum diagnosed by CT scan. We enrolled all consecutive adult blunt trauma patients (≥18 years old) who underwent whole-body CT before operation between February 2012 and October 2016. Patients with hemoperitoneum on CT images were included and categorized into hemodynamically stable and unstable (persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation) groups. Among 1723 severe blunt trauma patients, 136 patients with hemoperitoneum were included. Of these, 98 (72.1%) patients had documented intraperitoneal injury, and the liver (60.2%) was most frequently damaged site, followed by spleen (23.5%) and mesentery (23.5%). The rate of intraperitoneal organ injury did not differ between hemodynamically stable (n = 107) and unstable (n = 29) groups (69.2% vs 82.8%, P = .15), while the documented active internal bleeding was high in the unstable group (29.9% vs 69.0%, P < .001). In the unstable group, 14 (48.3%) patients underwent emergent operation, while 3 patients underwent embolization, and the others were treated in a conservative manner. Even in hemodynamically unstable hemoperitoneum patients, 17.2% had no documented intraperitoneal injury and over half of the patients were treated without emergent operation."

"ABSTRACT","Trauma promotes trauma-induced coagulopathy, which requires urgent treatment with fixed-ratio transfusions of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrates, or goal-directed administration of coagulation factors based on viscoelastic testing. This retrospective observational study compared two time periods before (2005–2007) and after (2012–2014) the implementation of changes in trauma management protocols which included: use of goal-directed coagulation management; admission of patients to designated trauma centres; whole-body computed tomography scanning on admission; damage control surgery; permissive hypotension; restrictive fluid resuscitation; and administration of tranexamic acid. The incidence of massive transfusion (≥ 10 units of red blood cells from emergency department arrival until intensive care unit admission) was compared with the predicted incidence according to the trauma associated severe haemorrhage score. All adult (≥ 16 years) trauma patients primarily admitted to the University Hospital Zürich with an injury severity score ≥ 16 were included. In 2005–2007, the observed and trauma associated severe haemorrhage score that predicted the incidence of massive transfusion were identical, whereas in 2012–2014 the observed incidence was less than half that predicted (3.7% vs. 7.5%). Compared to 2005–2007, the proportion of patients transfused with red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma was significantly lower in 2012–2014 in both the emergency department (43% vs. 17%; 31% vs. 6%, respectively), and after 24 h (53% vs. 27%; 37% vs. 16%, respectively). The use of tranexamic acid and coagulation factor XIII also increased significantly in the 2012–2014 time period. Implementation of a revised trauma management strategy, which included goal-directed coagulation management, was associated with a reduced incidence of massive transfusion and a reduction in the transfusion of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction Whole-body CT (WBCT) use in patients with trauma in England and Wales is not well documented. WBCT in trauma can reduce time to definitive care, thereby increasing survival. However, its use varies significantly worldwide. Methods We performed a retrospective observational study of Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) data from 2012 to 2014. The proportion of adult patients receiving WBCT during initial resuscitation at major trauma centres (MTCs) and trauma units/non-designated hospitals (TUs/NDHs) was compared. A model was developed that included factors associated with WBCT use, and centre effects within the model were explored to determine variation in usage beyond that expected from the model. Results Of the 115 664 study participants, 16.5% had WBCT. WBCT was performed five times more frequently in MTCs than in TUs/NDHs (31% vs 6.6%). In the multivariate model, increased injury severity, low GCS, shock, comorbidities and triage category increased the chances of having a WBCT, but there was no consistent relation with age. High falls and motor vehicle collisions also increased WBCT usage. Adjusting for casemix, there was a 13-fold intrahospital variation in the use of WBCT between MTCs and a 30-fold variation between TUs/NDHs. The amount of variability between individual hospitals that could not be accounted for by the factors shown to impact on WBCT use was 26% (95% CI 17% to 39%) for MTCs and 17% (95% CI 13% to 21%) for TUs/NDHs. Conclusion There are significant variations in WBCT use between different hospitals in England and Wales, which require further investigation."

"ABSTRACT","Learning Objectives 1. To learn the difference between solid organ and pelvic trauma patterns 2. To learn the approaches to pelvic trauma embolisation 3. To learn major complications of pelvic embolisation Approximately 1%-2% patients with pelvic ring fractures are hemodynamically unstable and one in 5 cases of unstability will be due to arterial bleeding (1). The early management of hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fractures poses a significant challenge owing to competing clinical priorities. The reported mortality is approximately 10%-40% of these cases, and uncontrolled pelvic bleeding is the main contributing factor with exsanguination as the leading cause of death within the first 24 hours. Successful management depends on accurate diagnostic staging and control of fracture- related hemorrhage. To improve the survival of these patients, the source of hemorrhage needs to be identified during the early phase of resuscitation for enabling rapid control of bleeding. Nontherapeutic laparotomy should be avoided in the initial phase, concentrating instead on arresting pelvic hemorrhage (2). The total time from patient injury to stopping the hemorrhage critically affects the outcome in which early whole-body CT plays an important role and improves the outcome (evidence level 3) (1,3). There is, however, no evidence that immediate whole-body CT is superior to conventional imaging and selective CT scanning in patients with severe trauma (4). In pelvic trauma, the negative predictive value of contrast extravasation is close to 100%, and thus, the pelvis will not be the source of hemorrhagic shock (evidence level 4) (5). The CT injury assessment provides the indication for and guides arterial embolization in a patient with stable injury. In very unstable patients, CT should be followed immediately by surgery or balloon occlusion to control bleeding (evidence level 2) (1,6,7,8). First-line treatment should include temporarily stabilizing the pelvic ring and secondarily preperitoneal packing and/or embolizing the artery depending on the organization of the local trauma center (9). Patients who demonstrate arterial bleeding on CT or who are hemodynamically unstable despite pelvic wrap are candidates for IR treatment. External fixation is mostly effective in controlling bleeding from bony and venous injury; if used in arterial bleeding, it may compromise the performance of embolization. The abnormalities, which represent embolization targets, include active bleeds, blush on CT, and/or vascular injuries (slow flow, irregularity in diameter, obstruction/cut-off sign with no-flow, arterial dissection, pseudo-aneurysm, and arteriovenous shunt). Angiography of the iliac bifurcation and common iliac arteries is performed together with that of the internal iliac arteries, femoral artery and its branches, and recurrent branches of the external iliac artery. No visible extravasation does not exclude an active bleed or vascular injury as the bleed might be intermittent with arterial collapse or arterial spasm which may recur when hemodynamics is restored. Embolization is highly effective (close to 100%) in stopping arterial bleeding in the context of pelvic injury (1) and therefore, justifies readily available access to this technique (24/24 hours, 7/7 days) in all level 1 trauma centers (9). The aim of arterial embolization is to obtain hemostasis without causing ischemic complications (by obstructing the artery involved proximal to the pre-capillary collaterals). Arterial embolization performed too proximally (proximal to the arterial collaterals) carries a risk of failing in terms of stopping the bleeding and re-bleeding. Excessively distal arterial embolization (distal to the pre-capillary collaterals) may cause ischemic tissue necrosis (9). Catheterization of the contralateral internal iliac artery to the bleeding side should always be performed after embolization of the target bleeding artery to observe if there is cross-over collateral arterial supply to the bleeding region. There are three types of embolization agents: 1) resorbable gelatin foam which provides temporary (approximately 4-6 weeks) proximal mechanical thrombotic obstruction. 2) Coils provide permanent thrombotic obstruction (or even mechanical if the packaging is dense or hydrocoils or plugs are used). The use of fibrous or active coils improves the occlusive effectiveness of the implantable device. Coagulopathy results in a reduction in the thrombogenic effectiveness of fibrous coils. 3) Liquid agents provide permanent mechanical obstruction. Their effectiveness is independent of the presence or absence of coagulopathy but they carry a risk of distal embolization. They can be used for non-selective embolization if hemostasis using gelatin foam has failed and in patients who are eligible for selective embolization with a target which is inaccessible by selective catheterization particularly if the patient is at high risk of re-bleeding from anastomoses (9). Glues can be delivered rapidly and can be used in extremis patients. Onyx requires preparation and slow delivery and cannot be used in extremis patients. Non-selective embolization with unilateral or bilateral obstruction of the internal iliac artery trunks using gelatin foam might be indicated in unstable patients, in patients who are stable with multiple bleeding targets, and if selective embolization has failed. If unstable hemodynamics persists on the angiography table, patients should be investigated for recanalization of the internal iliac arteries (as a result of release of spasm and restoration of normal volemia) and where appropriate, further embolization of the internal iliac arteries should be performed. If the internal iliac arteries have not recanalized, patients should be investigated for arterial bleed from another territories using dedicated angiography. Pseudoaneurysms require the artery to be embolized both proximal and distal to the pseudoaneurysm (“sandwich” packing) to prevent back door bleeding. Distal pseudoaneurysms, however, can be treated by obstructing the feeding artery proximal to the pseudoaneurysm only. Recurrent bleeding through anastamoses must be excluded with contralateral (internal iliac artery) and ipsilateral diagnostic arteriography. Complications after embolization are rare. For both surgical and IR treatments, complications are difficult to discriminate from those caused by the injury itself. Groin hematoma (particularly in coagulopathy) and more specific complications like gluteal, bladder, uterine, or rectal wall necrosis have been described after pelvic embolization. Sciatic and femoral nerve paralyses have also been described. Lower limb ischemia (particularly after prolonged balloon occlusion) and spinal cord arterial ischemia are also potential results after embolization. Most of these complications are described in case reports and in some cases might also be ascribed to the traumatic injury itself. Sexual dysfunction frequently occurs after pelvic trauma, and its incidence is not obviously increased by embolization. There is no significant increase in the risk of most evaluated long- and short-term complications in trauma patients who underwent internal iliac artery embolization versus those who did not. However, internal iliac artery embolization is associated with a marginally significant increased rate of buttocks, thigh, or perineal paresthesia (evidence level 3) (10). The infection rate after pelvic embolization and internal fixation of acetabular fractures has been shown to be approximately 4% and did not increase compared with that of patients who did not undergo embolization but underwent internal acetabular fracture fixation (therapeutic evidence level 3) (11). Embolization should be used to manage arterial bleeding resulting from pelvic trauma and should precede treatment other than pelvic binder (evidence level 3) (1)."

"ABSTRACT","Purpose: A close distance of the CT scanner to the trauma room has a significant positive effect on the probability of survival of severely injured patients. However, due to edificial condtions and other reasons, sometimes an implementation of an high-end scanner into the trauma room is not made or possible. In these cases, an alternative way for patient care may be to equip a CTunit in this way that it can be used as a trauma room for the supply of severely injured patients. Methods and Materials: First, a multidisciplinary shockroom protocol was established, with anaesthesiology, traumatic surgery, and radiology being the core disciplines in the acute care of polytraumatized patients after admittance in the hospital. According to this protocol, there was a strict triage of severely injured patients: hemodynamically stable or latent stable patients were transferred to the CTunit,whereas hemodynamically unstable patients underwent an emergeny operation after primary survey. For assessment of process quality, GCS and ISS scores, time between arrival and end of whole body CT, patient outcome (lethality, duration of stay in hospital, etc.) were recorded and sent to the German Trauma Register which is under the surveillance of the German Society of Traumatologic Surgery. Results: In the year 2014, the mean ISS score of severly injured patients was 25.0, and thus higher than that of the nation-wide population (mean 18.4). Mean time for transportation of the patient to the CTunit was 1 minte and 40 seconds. Mean time interval between arrival of the patients and end of whoel body CT was 17 +/- 13 minutes. Patients had an lethality of 15.3 %, but this was significantly lower in comparison with that calculated on the basis of injury severity of 18.5 %. In other words, outcome of patients was better with regard to injury severity based on the nation-wide data Conclusion: The use of a CT unit with appropriate room facilities and equipment as a temporary shockroom may be an alternative to standard recommendations in cases where edificial constraints do not allow an implementation of a high-end CT scanner in the trauma room. However, basic requirement for its successful use is the consequent adherance to the multidiciplinary shockroom protocol and repeated training of all personnel involved in the care of polytraumatized patients."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction Traumatic rupture of aortic isthmus is a major problem in the management of polytraumatized patient. Except the complete rupture of the aorta, treatment should be initiated after hemodynamic and respiratory stabilization and after treating a lesion involving life-threatening. Patients and methods This is a prospective analysis over a period of 18 months between January 2014 and July 2015. Twelve polytraumatized patients were admitted to our ICU with rupture of aortic isthmus. All patients underwent a whole body CT with angio-CT of mediastinal vessels. Results During this period, among 300 polytraumatized patients were admitted to our ICU, 180 of them had chest trauma (60 %) of which 12 patients had a traumatic rupture of aortic isthmus (4 %). The median age was 43 [27-64] years. All patients were male. The mechanism of injury was road traffic accident (motorcycle in 2 cases, motor vehicle in 5 cases). All patients required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory or neurological distress. Four patients (25 %) had a Glasgow Coma Scale Score less than 12/15. Eight patients (75 %) had a hypoxemic report PaO(2)/FiO(2) less than 200. One patient was initially in shock. The median SAPSII was 28 [22-48]. The median SOFA score was 3 [2-5]. The median Shock Index was 0.70 [0.61-0.97]. After hemodynamic and respiratory stabilization, all patients underwent a whole body CT with angio-CT of mediastinal vessels. We noted head trauma in 4 patients (25 %), abdominal trauma in 9 patients (75 %), fractures of pelvis in 6 patients (50 %) and fractures of the long bones in 10 patients (83.3 %). The rupture of aortic isthmus was associated with odds fractures in 10 patients (83.3 %), pneumothorax in 6 patients (50 %), hemothorax in 5 patients (41 %) and pulmonary contusions in all patients. A tracheotomy was performed in 8 patients (66.6 %). The ICU stay was complicated by nosocomial pneumonia in all patients and pulmonary embolism in 6 patients (50 %), septicemia in 5 patients (41 %). Eleven of 12 patients underwent endovascular treatment. The median interval between admission in ICU and endovascular treatment was 18 [7-30] days. All patients received a single stent, mean length 25 ± 1 mm. There was no conversion to an open approach. The median ICU stay was 30 [14-48] days. Two patients died: the first before endovascular treatment because of cerebral herniation, the second after endovascular treatment because of a septic shock. All surviving patients had a clinical and radiological follow-up every 3 months. No morbidity was noted until this day. Conclusion Diagnosis of traumatic rupture of aortic isthmus should be considered in any serious polytrauma. Except the complete rupture of the aorta, treatment of these lesions can be done after stabilization of a lesion involving the immediate prognosis. Endovascular treatment became the treatment of choice, especially for patients with severe associated injuries and bleeding risk. Additional data on the long-term stents are necessary in these young patients."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction Whole body CT (WBCT) scan is known to be associated with significant radiation risk especially in pediatric trauma patients. The aim of this study was to assess the use WBCT scan across trauma centers for the management of pediatric trauma patients. Methods We performed a two year (2011-2012) retrospective analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank. Pediatric (age ≤ 18 years) trauma patients managed in level I or II adult or pediatric trauma centers with a head, neck, thoracic, or abdominal CT scan were included. WBCT scan was defined as CT scan of the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen. Patients were stratified into two groups: patients managed in adult centers and patients managed in designated pediatric centers. Outcome measure was use of WBCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Results A total of 30,667 pediatric trauma patients were included of which; 38.3% (n = 11,748) were managed in designated pediatric centers. 26.1% (n = 8013) patients received a WBCT. The use of WBCT scan was significantly higher in adult trauma centers in comparison to pediatric centers (31.4% vs. 17.6%, p = 0.001). There was no difference in mortality rate between the two groups (2.2% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.37). After adjusting for all confounding factors, pediatric patients managed in adult centers were 1.8 times more likely to receive a WBCT compared to patients managed in pediatric centers (OR [95% CI]: 1.8 [1.3-2.1], p = 0.001). Conclusions Variability exists in the use of WBCT scan across trauma centers with no difference in patient outcomes. Pediatric patients managed in adult trauma centers were more likely to be managed with WBCT, increasing their risk for radiation without a difference in outcomes. Establishing guidelines for minimizing the use of WBCT across centers is warranted."

"ABSTRACT","INTRODUCTION: Despite the high frequency of thoracic injuries secondary to traffic related accidents, the blunt cardiac valve rupture is extremely rare.METHOD: Case report and review of the literature using PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.RESULT: A 38 year old female patient, victim of car accident was admitted. On primary survey the patient was conscious, cooperative and hemodynamic and respiratory stable. On secondary survey was found a bilateral open leg fracture and a seat belt sign. Whole body Computed Tomography revealed minimal haemorrhagic contusion of the cortex, left hemopneumothorax and right pneumothorax, bilateral rib fractures, liver contusion, left femoral neck fracture and fracture to the lumbar spinal column. After bilateral pleurostomy, the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, but with no signs of external bleeding. The transthoracic echocardiography revealed an acute severe tricuspid regurgitation with hepatic veins reflux. After orthopaedic surgeries, the tricuspid valve rupture was managed by replacing the valve with a bioprostheses. The hospital stay was 122 days.CONCLUSION: Only a high index of suspicion may reveal blunt cardiac lesions as a cause for hemodynamic instability in acute setting."

"ABSTRACT","Study objective: Widespread chest CT use in trauma evaluation may increase the diagnosis of minor sternal fracture (SF), making former teaching about SF obsolete. We sought to determine: (1) the frequency with which SF patients are diagnosed by CXR versus chest CT under current imaging protocols, (2) the frequency of surgical procedures related to SF diagnosis, (3) SF patient mortality and hospital length of stay comparing patients with isolated sternal fracture (ISF) and sternal fracture with other thoracic injury (SFOTI), and (4) the frequency and yield of cardiac contusion (CC) workups in SF patients. Methods: We analyzed charts and data of all SF patients enrolled from January 2009 to May 2013 in the NEXUS Chest and NEXUS Chest CT studies, two multi-centre observational cohorts of blunt trauma patients who received chest imaging for trauma evaluation. Results: Of the 14,553 patients in the NEXUS Chest and Chest CT cohorts, 292 (2.0%) were diagnosed with SF, and 94% of SF were visible on chest CT only. Only one patient (0.4%) had a surgical procedure related to SF diagnosis. Cardiac contusion was diagnosed in 7 (2.4%) of SF patients. SF patient mortality was low (3.8%) and not significantly different than the mortality of patients without SF (3.1%) [mean difference 0.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.0 to 3.5%]. Only 2 SF patient deaths (0.7%) were attributed to a cardiac cause. SFOTI patients had longer hospital stays but similar mortality to patients with ISF (mean difference 0.8%; 95% CI -4.7% to 12.0). Conclusions: Most SF are seen on CT only and the vast majority are clinically insignificant with no change in treatment and low associated mortality. Workup for CC in SF patients is a low-yield practice. SF diagnostic and management guidelines should be updated to reflect modern CT-driven trauma evaluation protocols."

"ABSTRACT","We report a case of a false-positive focused abdominal sonography in trauma (FAST) examination in a persistently hypotensive pediatric trauma patient, performed 12 hours after the trauma, suspected to be caused by massive fluid resuscitation leading to ascites. While a positive FAST in a hypotensive trauma patient usually indicates hemoperitoneum, this case illustrates that the timing of the FAST examination relative to the injury, as well as clinical evolution including the volume of fluid resuscitation, need to be considered when interpreting the results of serial and/or late FAST examinations."

"ABSTRACT","Traumatic pulmonary pseudocyst (TPP) is a rare complication following blunt trauma. We report a 26-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency room with internal bleeding and shock. Huge TPP (14cm in diameter) was seen on whole-body computed tomography scan and complicated with bronchial bleeding. He deteriorated to respiratory failure soon after arriving at the emergency room. TPPs imply high-energy impact on the chest region and frequently complicated with pulmonary contusions, hemo- and pneumo-thorax, multiple rib fractures, flail chest, and concurrent with abdominal injuries. Emergency physicians should be aware of such rare entity and manage correctly."

"ABSTRACT","Aim: This article reiterates some of the essential core statements of the S3 guidelines and also gives an overview of new scientific studies.Background: The recommendations still have to be implemented 3 years after publication of the S3 guidelines on the treatment of patients with severe and multiple injuries.Material and methods: In a selective literature search new studies on airway management, traumatic cardiac arrest, shock classification, coagulation therapy, whole-body computed tomography, air rescue and trauma centers were identified and are discussed in the light of the S3 guideline recommendations.Conclusion: The recommendations on interdisciplinary trauma management contained in the S3 guidelines on the treatment of patients with severe and multiple injuries should be implemented into the clinical routine. Additionally, the knowledge gained from more recent scientific studies is necessary for anesthetists and emergency physicians to be able to adequately implement the core statements of the S3 guidelines for the treatment of patients with severe and multiple injuries.Results: The recommendations on airway management are up to date; however, recommendations on difficult airway evaluation tools, e.g. the LEMON law, should be included. The first pass success (i.e. intubation success at the first attempt) must be considered as a quality marker in the future. Video laryngoscopy is identified as a leading airway procedure in order to reach this aim. Recently estimated learning curves for endotracheal intubation and supraglottic airway devices should be implemented in qualification statements. Life-saving emergency interventions have to be performed in the prehospital setting as they do not prolong the complete treatment period for severely injured patients up to discharge from the resuscitation room. The outcome of patients suffering from traumatic cardiac arrest is better than expected. Recently developed algorithms for trauma patients have to be implemented. The prehospital trauma life support (PHTLS) and advanced trauma life support (ATLS) shock classification does not reflect the clinical reality; therefore, lactate, lactate clearance and base deficit should be used for evaluating the shock state in the resuscitation room. Concerning coagulation therapy, tranexamic acid is easy to administer, safe and effective as an antifibrinolytic therapy and should not be restricted to the most severely injured patients. Numerous studies have shown the positive effect of whole-body computed tomography on treatment time and outcome; however, clear indications for the use of whole-body computed tomography are lacking. Further investigations supported the positive effects of air rescue on the treatment outcome of trauma patients."

"ABSTRACT","Background The early diagnosis of pelvic arterial haemorrhage is challenging for initiating treatment by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in multiple trauma patients. We use an institutional algorithm focusing on haemodynamic status on admission and on a whole-body CT scan in stabilized patients to screen patients requiring TAE. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of this approach. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 106 multiple trauma patients admitted to the emergency room with serious pelvic fracture [pelvic abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score of 3 or more]. Results Of the 106 patients, 27 (25%) underwent pelvic angiography leading to TAE for active arterial haemorrhage in 24. The TAE procedure was successful within 3 h of arrival in 18 patients. In accordance with the algorithm, 10 patients were directly admitted to the angiography unit (n = 8) and/or operating room (n = 2) for uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock on admission. Of the remaining 96 stabilized patients, 20 had contrast media extravasation on pelvic CT scan that prompted pelvic angiography in 16 patients leading to TAE in 14. One patient underwent a pelvic angiography despite showing no contrast media extravasation on pelvic CT scan. All 17 stabilized patients who underwent pelvic angiography presented a more severely compromised haemodynamic status on admission, and they required more blood products during their initial management than the 79 patients who did not undergo pelvic angiography. The incidence of unstable pelvic fractures was however comparable between the two groups. Overall, haemodynamic instability and contrast media extravasation on the CT-scan identified 26 out of the 27 patients who required subsequent pelvic angiography leading to TAE in 24. Conclusions An algorithm focusing on haemodynamic status on arrival and on the whole-body CT scan in stabilized patients may be effective at triaging multiple trauma patients with serious pelvic fractures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"ABSTRACT","Introduction Radiology-based classifications of pelvic ring injuries and their relevance for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality are disputed in the literature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential differences between the pelvic ring injury classification systems by Tile and by Young and Burgess with regard to their predictive value on mortality, transfusion/infusion requirement and concomitant injuries. Patients and methods Two-hundred-and- eighty-five consecutive patients with pelvic ring fractures were analyzed for mortality within 30 days after admission, number of blood units and total volume of fluid infused during the first 24 h after trauma, the Abbreviated Injury Severity (AIS) scores for head, chest, spine, abdomen and extremities as a function of the Tile and the Young-Burgess classifications. Results There was no significant relationship between occurrence of death and fracture pattern but a significant relationship between fracture pattern and need for blood units/total fluid volume for Tile (p <.001/p <.001) and Young-Burgess (p <.001/p <.001). In both classifications, open book fractures were associated with more fluid requirement and more severe injuries of the abdomen, spine and extremities (p <.05). When divided into the larger subgroups ""partially stable"" and ""unstable"", unstable fractures were associated with a higher mortality rate in the Young-Burgess system (p =.036). In both classifications, patients with unstable fractures required significantly more blood transfusions (p <.001) and total fluid infusion (p <.001) and higher AIS scores. Conclusions In this first direct comparison of both classifications, we found no clinical relevant differences with regard to their predictive value on mortality, transfusion/infusion requirement and concomitant injuries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

"ABSTRACT","Background:The current common and dogmatic opinion is that whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) should not be performed in major trauma patients in shock. We aimed to assess whether WBCT during trauma-room treatment has any effect on the mortality of severely injured patients in shock.Methods:In a retrospective multicenter cohort study involving 16719 adult blunt major trauma patients we compared the survival of patients who were in moderate, severe or no shock (systolic blood pressure 90-110,<90 or >110 mmHg) at hospital admission and who received WBCT during resuscitation to those who did not. Using data derived from the 2002-2009 version of TraumaRegister®, we determined the observed and predicted mortality and calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) as well as logistic regressions.Findings:9233 (55.2%) of the 16719 patients received WBCT. The mean injury severity score was 28.8±12.1. The overall mortality rate was 17.4% (SMR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.81-0.89) for patients with WBCT and 21.4% (SMR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-1.02) for those without WBCT (p<0.001). 4280 (25.6%) patients were in moderate shock and 1821 (10.9%) in severe shock. The mortality rate for patients in moderate shock with WBCT was 18.1% (SMR 0.85, CI95% 0.78-0.93) compared to 22.6% (SMR 1.03, CI95% 0.94-1.12) to those without WBCT (p<0.001, p = 0.002 for the SMRs). The mortality rate for patients in severe shock with WBCT was 42.1% (SMR 0.99, CI95% 0.92-1.06) compared to 54.9% (SMR 1.10, CI95% 1.02-1.16) to those without WBCT (p<0.001, p = 0.049 for the SMRs). Adjusted logistic regression analyses showed that WBCT is an independent predictor for survival that significantly increases the chance of survival in patients in moderate shock (OR = 0.73; 95%CI 0.60-0.90, p = 0.002) as well as in severe shock (OR = 0.67; 95%CI 0.52-0.88, p = 0.004). The number needed to scan related to survival was 35 for all patients, 26 for those in moderate shock and 20 for those in severe shock.Conclusions:WBCT during trauma resuscitation significantly increased the survival in haemodynamically stable as well as in haemodynamically unstable major trauma patients. Thus, the application of WBCT in haemodynamically unstable severely injured patients seems to be safe, feasible and justified if performed quickly within a well-structured environment and by a well-organized trauma team. © 2013 Huber-Wagner et al."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: The blunt trauma victim management is still a matter of debate and comparing studies involving different emergency medical services and health care organization remains fictitious. Hence, the French Intensive care Recorded in Severe Trauma (FIRST) was conducted in order to describe the severe blunt trauma management in France. The present paper aimed at recalling the main results of FIRST study. Methods: The FIRST study was based on a multicenter prospective cohort of patients aged 18 or over with severe exclusive blunt trauma requiring admission to university hospital care unit within the first 72. h and/or managed by medical-Staffed Emergency Mobile Unit (SMUR). Multiple data were collected about patient characteristics, clinical initial status, typology of trauma and the main endpoints were 30-day mortality. Results: Sixty-one percent of trauma patients were road traffic victims and 30% were domestic, sport or leisure trauma. Patients who benefited from medical pre-hospital management were globally more severely injured than those who received basic life support care by fire brigades. Therefore, they were delivered more aggressive treatment in the pre-hospital setting and the median time for their hospital admission was lengthened. However, their 30-day mortality was significantly reduced. The probability of death was also decreased when casualties were transported by SMUR helicopter directly to the university hospital. In the in-hospital setting, the performance of a whole-body computed tomography (CT) was associated with a significant reduction in the mortality risk compared with a selective CT. Conclusion: The FIRST study suggests the benefit of a medical management in the pre-hospital setting on the survival of trauma patients. The emergency physician (EP) expertise in the pre-hospital and initial hospital phases would lead to the concept of the appropriate care for the appropriate trauma patient. It also highlights the necessity to set up organized regional sectors of care and registries. © 2013 Société française d'anesthésie et de réanimation (Sfar)."

"ABSTRACT","Learning Objectives 1. To review management and work-up for pelvic trauma 2. To review techniques of embolization for pelvic traumatic haemorrhage 3. To review results and complications of embolization for pelvic traumatic haemorrhage INTRODUCTION: According to the WHO there are 10 million injuries and 300,000 deaths per year worldwide in traffic accidents. Trauma is the leading source of death under 45 years in developed countries. When a patient arrives into the emergency room and during the initial resuscitation procedures a first diagnostic survey must be done with total body CT whenever possible to identify those major injuries that may require a lifesaving emergent surgical intervention. After thoracic trauma, tamponade and abdominal hemorrhage, pelvic fracture is the third priority in the management of polytrauma patients. The presence of pelvic trauma adds significant morbidity and mortality and isolated pelvic fractures are also a major problem. Pelvic ring fractures with major ligament disruptions (APC II, LC II, vertical shear) or acetabular fractures involving the anterior column trigger major bleeding and require blood transfusions. Uncontrolled pelvic hemorrhage has a high mortality rate and 60% of early deaths in pelvic trauma are due to bleeding; otherwise, bleeding is the most treatable cause of death. Car and motorcycle accidents, falls and pedestrians being run over are the most frequent involved mechanisms for pelvic trauma. IR plays a well-established role and embolization is an accepted alternative to surgery for patients with active pelvic bleeding. To review management and work-up for pelvic trauma For injury detection CTMD has a higher sensitivity and specificity than the physical and clinical examination. A CT protocol with multiphase acquisitions and multiplanar and volume reconstructions are mandatory in these patients. CT angiography should be part of the protocol. Interventional radiology (IR) has no primary role during the initial management of these patients at the emergency room. In traumatic pelvic hemorrhage venous bleeding occurs in 80 - 90 % of cases. Presacral venous plexus and bleeding directly from fractured bones are the most common sources of venous bleeding. Conservative management with blood transfusions, pneumatic antishock garment and external fixation for unstable pelvic fractures is usually enough for venous bleeding control. As the hematoma grows, intrapelvic pressure increases causing hemostasis. Most persistent pelvic bleeding is due to internal iliac artery branch tears, and those patients are the best candidates for treatment by embolization. Pelvic CT angiography may guide the clinical decisions for patients with blunt and penetrating pelvic trauma. It has capability to differentiate between venous and arterial active hemorrhage, the quantification of blood loss and the severity of injury to major arteries. Prior to embolization, CTA is also very useful to determine the precise location of the injured arterial branch. We must keep in mind that sometimes several branches may be affected. In case that extravasation is not seen, the progression of the hematoma in a CT control is an important finding and can be explained by intermittent bleeding. The “Cut off” sign may be present and indicates arterial transection or dissection that could evolve into pseudoaneurysm or active bleeding when the blood pressure goes up and the blood clots dislodge. In addition to the information obtained from CT we also have to take into account the blood requirements. More than 4 packed cells per day or 6/48 Hs directly related to pelvic fracture is another indication for embolization. There are some algorithms for the management of patients with pelvic fractures but in short we can summarize the indications for embolization in pelvic trauma as follows: 1. Primary management in a hemodynamically unstable patients with isolated pelvic fracture and no relevant injuries in the rest of the whole body. 2. Primary management in a hemodynamically stable patient suffering from blunt or penetrating pelvic trauma with active arterial bleeding depicted on CTMD. 3. Secondary management when active arterial bleeding is not detected but some hours or days after admittance the red cell count decreases and/or the pelvic hematoma size increases. 4. Secondary management in venous active bleeding when conservative and orthopedic treatments have failed. 5. As secondary rescue manoeuvres when bleeding control surgery fails. Embolization may be the only option. 6. “Prophylactic” embolization may be justified in some particular cases with no active bleeding but high risk of rebleeding because of “cut off” sign, coagulopathy or previous cumarin treatments. To review techniques of embolization for pelvic traumatic haemorrhage If the previous CTA is clear enough we can go directly into a selective catheterization of the injured vessel avoiding the pelvic angiography and saving time and iodinated contrast. We do selective runs of both internal iliac arteries. We should pay attention to extravasations of contrast medium but also to the “cut off” signs. We recommend a crossover 6F guiding catheter or long braided sheath located in the trunk of the internal iliac artery. We will be able to perform selective and control angiograms from the side port of the 6F device. In a second step we will advance as selective as possible a co-axial either 4 F hydrophilic catheter or microcatheter. Only in those patients severely hypotensive, a quick non-selective occlusion is justified. We must remember that our goal is bleeding control. The former surgical ligation of proximal internal iliac artery is ruled out due to its poor results. If we make a proximal truncal occlusion we will preclude further interventions and persistent pelvic bleeding will be possible through collaterals. The choice of embolic agent and technique depends on the site and type of injury, clinical scenario, available options and personal experience. To choose the embolic agent we will consider the bleeding severity and we need to know if it is focal or diffuse, proximal or distal. We will also consider if there is a venous hemorrhage associated. The pelvis is quite resistant to ischemia so we will be able to perform more aggressive embolizations than in other organs or territories. Gelatin sponge is the most popular embolic agent; it is cheap and easily available although it may fail due to reabsorption and vessel recanalization mainly in the presence of coagulopathy. It is an appropriate embolic material when the bleeding point is located at a distal branch inaccessible to the microcatheter. Coils and microcoils are appropriate for focal bleeding where selective catheterization is possible or to embolize proximal vessel in order to reduce the perfusion pressure. If blood flow pressure is high and coagulopathy is present, residual flow through the coils may persist. Calibrated synthetic microspheres are useful for distal diffuse multiple small bleeders and large diameter particles should be used (>500 μ). Liquid embolic agents, NBCA and EVOH, are in our experience more effective and feasible than others agents in terms of hemostasis and prevention of recurrent hemorrhage. It works for distal and for proximal occlusions, for focal and diffuse, with an immediate effect, and is not conditioned by the coagulopathy. Combinations of different agents are feasible and may be done to achieve simultaneous distal and proximal embolization. In special cases temporal inflow arterial occlusion balloon allows the patient to be stabilized during treatment. Stent grafting may be considered to maintain distal flow of the main pelvic arteries and in case of threatening pseudoaneurysm. Embolization is contraindicated in patients who are severely unstable. These patients with major and multiple injuries require emergency surgery and intensive care support. When bleeding sources are multiple and from different sites embolization is not indicated. Results and complications Embolization is very effective in controlling arterial bleeding with success rates of 80 - 95%. However, global survival rates are quite variable and depend on the number and extent of other organ injuries, patient hemodynamic status, the delay between trauma and embolization, the experience and availability of the IR team and the number of vessels involved. Complications after embolization are usually minor and occur in less than 10% of cases. Besides the puncture site-related complications, distal necrosis is a possible complication of any embolization but is not frequent in the pelvic area. Nontarget embolization due to unintentional reflux of the embolization material into the femoral artery can cause leg ischemia. Sciatic and sacral plexus palsy has been reported. Sexual dysfunction is more likely the result of nerve injury and pelvic fracture."

"ABSTRACT","Aim: The FIRST study (French Intensive care Recorded in Severe Trauma) was designed in order to describe the French management of severe blunt trauma in collaboration with 14 University hospitals. Procedure: Epidemiological, clinical data of pre- and in-hospital evolution were prospectively recorded for 3090 patients admitted in ICU within 72 hours after trauma and/or managed by a prehospital medical team of a participant center. Results: The mean age is 42 years old (SD 18), 61% of patients are road traffic victims, 30% are miscellaneous accidents victims (domestic, sports...)and 7% are involved in work accident and 2% in other type of accident. More than 50% of patients are intubated during prehospital care. Median Coma Glasgow Score is 12; IQR [6; 15]. After prehospital management, mean arterial pressure evolves from 89 mmHg (SD 29) to 84 mmHg (SD 23). Mean prehospital fluid loading is 788 ± 862 ml and 16% of patients receive prehospital continuous catecholamine infusion. Nearly 25% of patients are initially admitted in a general hospital before University hospital transfer. Such strategy increases delay admission to University hospital (1,9 hours, IQR [1,3-2,5 hours] to 6,4 hours, IQR [5,0-8,4 hours], p <0,001. Many patients were not managed by a medical prehospital team (7%) and whole-body CT on admission is not systematically performed. The injury severity score (median ISS: 25; IQR [18; 34]) may explain the time stay in intensive care unit (7 days), IQR [2-19 days] where 57% of patients have sepsis complications, and the global mortality of 23% at the 30(th) day. Conclusion: This study shows that all recommendations are well followed and promotes the installation of formalized regional care systems. © 2012 Société française de médecine d'urgence and Springer-Verlag France."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction: A retrospective analysis based on the data of the German Trauma Registry has shown a significant increase in the probability of survival in polytrauma patients submitted to whole body CT (WBCT). However, even when the CT is installed in the Emergency Department, the time required for positioning the patient for CT may significantly prolong the duration of CT diagnosis. Methods: Our hospital is a level 1 trauma center with a catchment population of 2.5 million; there are two CT scans in the ED. All severely injured patients are submitted to US on admission. WBCT is performed as the first-line radiologic investigation in haemodynamic-stable patients or in unstable patients with negative abdominal US and without a clear source of bleeding. Unstable patients with severe head trauma and lateral signs are also submitted to CT. To evaluate whether the use of CT in the severely unstable patients brings a significant delay in emergency surgery, we retrospectively analyzed all early trauma death from January 2009 to November 2010. Results: Seven hundred severe trauma patients (ISS >15) were brought in alive. Thirty-eight (5.4%) died before ICU admission: 21 died in the shock room before any surgical intervention. One patient was submitted to thoracotomy and laparothomy in the shock room and died. One more died on the CT table. The remaining 15 patients, severely hypotensive, were alive on admission to the OR. One of them was brought directly to the OR with no investigation because of massive bleeding from the extremities. The others had US on admission. US was the only investigation for seven of them; they all had a positive US showing important bleeding in the abdomen or in the chest. The other seven, who had no evidence of bleeding on the US, were submitted to WBCT. The mean time elapsed from hospital admission to OR entrance was 23 minutes (15 to 30 minutes) for patients who had only US and 70 minutes (52 to 90 minutes) for the CT group. The seven patients who had only US were all submitted to shock room decompressive minithoracotomy (five bilateral) with the suspicion of pneumothorax. Conclusions: Recent reports suggest implementation of multi-slice CT integrated into the resuscitation room, thus enabling resuscitation to be performed directly on the ER CT. Unless this new technology is adopted, even the ED-based CT still needs excessive time to be performed in most unstable patients. In a cohort of patients who eventually died in the OR, a diagnostic process including ED-based WBCT was associated with a threefold increase in the time needed from hospital admission to surgery."

"ABSTRACT","Background/Hypothesis: The benefits of Whole body Computed Tomography (WBCT) include faster diagnosis, fewer missed injuries and mortality benefits. Critics of WBCT cite high radiation exposure, degradation of doctors' clinical acumen and rising healthcare cost as pitfalls. We set out to investigate the differences in outcome between WBCT and Organ Specific CT (OSCT) at a major trauma centre in Singapore - Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Methods: Patients are triaged and stabilised by the resuscitation team at Accident and Emergency (A&E). Unstable patients who need surgery are sent to the operating room without scans. Of the stable ones, some get OSCT to complement the clinical assessment, X rays and sonographic findings. Others get WBCT as part of the initial workup. The decisionis based on the resuscitation team's assessment. Patients admitted from Jan 2008 to Dec 2009 were selected. Inclusion criteria - multi-organ trauma patients admitted to the General Surgery Department who had either OSCT or WBCT. Those with isolated head injuries or purely orthopedic injuries were excluded. Results: Two hundred and sixty-six patients met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-four had WBCT while 212 underwent OSCT. The mean probability of survival (TRISS) for OSCT is 94.8% and actual survival is 97.2%. The PS for WBCT is 77.7% and actual survival is 83.3%. Of 212 OSCT, 17.9% (38) needed a repeat trip to the CT scan to complete the diagnostic work up. Of these, 31.6% (12) had either missed injuries or needed a change in management because of the additional information from the CT scan. Discussion & Conclusion: Our study suggests a mortality benefit associated with WBCT, similar to findings by Wagner et al, Lancet 2009. Doctors needed more information in 17.9% of OSCT patients and had to send them for additional scans to complete the workup. This means unnecessary movement of critically ill patients. Moreover, 31.6% of patients who needed the additional scans have missed injuries. Our centre is seeking grants for a randomised trial to further prove that WBCT is indeed superior."

"ABSTRACT","Introduction According to the WHO, there are 10 million injuries and 300,000 deaths per year worldwide in traffic accidents. Trauma is the leading source of death under 45 years in developed countries. When the patient arrives into emergency room and during the initial resuscitation maneuvers, a first diagnostic survey must be done with plain film and US FAST protocol to identify those major injuries that may require a lifesaving emergent surgical intervention. This hemodynamically unstable patient has no time to lose and no more imaging work up is necessary before a stabilization surgery. Interventional radiology rarely has a primary role in the initial management of these patients. When patients are hemodynamically stable, we have the possibility of carefully examine the number, location and extent of all injured organs and structures in order to determine the treatment priority. CTMD is undoubtedly the second diagnostic survey for those hemodynamically stable trauma victims. A whole body CT is actually the choice and provides a rapid and complete assessment of those areas affected in the polytrauma setting. For injuries, detection CTMD has a higher sensitivity and specificity than the physical and clinical examinations. A CT protocol with and without intravenous contrast, multiphase acquisitions and multiplanar and volume reconstructions are mandatory. CT angiography should be part of the protocol. After thoracic trauma, tamponade and abdominal hemorrhage, pelvic fracture is the third priority in the management of polytrauma patients. The presence of pelvic trauma adds significant morbidity and mortality and isolated pelvic fractures are also a major problem. Pelvic ring fractures with major ligaments disruptions (APC II, LC II, vertical shear) or acetabular fractures involving the anterior column trigger major bleeding and require blood transfusions. Uncontrolled pelvic hemorrhage has a high mortality rate and 60% of early deaths in pelvic trauma are due to bleeding; otherwise, bleeding is the most treatable cause of death. Motorcycle, falls and pedestrians running over accidents are the most frequent involved mechanisms for pelvic trauma. Interventional radiology plays a well-established role and embolization is an accepted alternative to surgery for patients with active pelvic bleeding. Indications for embolization in pelvic trauma In traumatic pelvic hemorrhage venous bleeding occurs in 80 - 90 % of cases. Presacral venous plexus and bleeding directly from fractured bone are the most common sources of venous bleeding. Conservative management with blood transfusions, pneumatic antishock garment and external fixation for unstable pelvic fractures is usually enough for venous bleeding control. As the hematoma grows, intrapelvic pressure increases causing hemostasis. Most persistent pelvic bleeding is due to internal iliac artery branches tears, and those patients are the best candidates for treatment by embolization. Given its capability to facilitate differentiation between active venous and active arterial hemorrhage, the quantification of blood loss and the major arteries injury severity, pelvic CT angiography may guide the clinical decisions for patients with blunt and penetrating pelvic trauma. Prior to embolization, CTA is very useful to determine the precise location of the injured arterial branch. We must bear in mind that sometimes several branches may be affected. In case that extravasation is not seen, the progression of the hematoma in a CT control is an important finding that can be explained by intermittent bleeding. The “cut off” sign may be present and indicates arterial transection or dissection that could evolve into pseudoaneurysm or active bleeding when the blood pressure goes up and the blood clot dislodges. In addition to the information obtained from CT, we also have to take into account the blood requirements. More than four packed cells/24 Hs or 6/48 Hs directly related to pelvic fracture is another indication for embolization. There are some algorithms for the management of patients with pelvic fractures but in summary we can summarize the indications for embolization in pelvic trauma as follows: 1. Primary management in a hemodynamically unstable patient with isolated pelvic fracture and no relevant injuries in the rest of the whole body. 2. Primary management in a hemodynamically stable patient suffering of blunt or penetrating pelvic trauma with active arterial bleeding depicted on CTMD. 3. Secondary management when active arterial bleeding is not detected but some hours or days after admittance the red cell count decreases and/or the pelvic hematoma size increases. 4. Secondary management in venous active bleeding when conservative and orthopedic treatment has failed. 5. As secondary rescue maneuvers when bleeding control surgery fails. Embolization may be the only option. 6. “Prophylactic” embolization may be justified in some particular cases with no active bleeding but high risk of rebreeding because “cut off” sign, coagulopathy or previous cumarin treatments. Technique including catheteres and embolic agents We choose a contralateral femoral approach and obtain a pelvic angiogram with a pigtail catheter placed in the distal aorta followed by selective runs of both Internal Iliac arteries. We should pay attention to extravasations of contrast medium but also to the “cut off” signs. If the previous CTA is clear enough we can go directly into a selective catheterization of the injured vessel avoiding the pelvic angiography and saving time and iodinated contrast. We advocate a crossover 6F guiding catheter or long braided sheath located in the trunk of the internal iliac artery. We will be able to perform selective and control angiograms from the side port of the 6F device. In a second step, we will advance as selective as possible a co-axial either 4 F hydrophilic catheter or microcatheter. Only in those patients severely hypotensive a quick non-selective occlusion is justified. We must remember that our goal is bleeding control. The former surgical ligation of proximal Internal Iliac artery is run out due to its poor results. If we make a proximal truncal occlusion, we will preclude further interventions and persistent pelvic bleeding will be possible through collaterals. The choice of embolic agent and technique depends on the site and type of injury, clinical scenario, available options and personal experience. To choose the embolic agent, we will consider the bleeding severity and if it is focal or diffuse, proximal or distal. We will also consider if there is a venous hemorrhage associated. The pelvis is quite resistant to ischemia so we will be able to perform more aggressive embolizations than in other organs or territories. Gelatin sponge is the most popular embolic agent; it is cheap and easily available although it may fail due to reabsorption and vessel recanalization mainly in the presence of coagulopathy. It is an appropriate embolic material when the bleeding point is located at a distal branch inaccessible to the microcatheter. Coils and microcoils are appropriate for focal bleeding where selective catheterization is possible or to embolize proximal vessel in order to reduce the perfusion pressure. If blood flow pressure is high and coagulopathy is present, residual flow through the coils may persist. Calibrated synthetic microspheres are useful for distal diffuse multiple small bleeders and large diameter particles should be used (> 500 μ). Liquid embolic agents, NBCA and Onyx, are in our experience more effective and feasible than others agents in terms of hemostasis and prevention of recurrent hemorrhage. It works for distal and for proximal occlusions, for focal and diffuse, with an immediate effect, and is not conditioned by the coagulopathy. Combinations of different agents are feasible and may be done to achieve simultaneous distal and proximal embolization. In special cases, temporal inflow arterial occlusion balloon allows the patient to be stabilized during treatment. Stent grafting may be considered to maintain distal flow of the main pelvic arteries and in case of threatening pseudoaneurysm. Embolization is contraindicated in patients who are severely unstable. These patients with major and multiple injuries require emergent surgery and intensive care support. When bleeding sources are multiple and from different sites embolization is not indicated. Results and complications Embolization is very effective in controlling arterial bleeding with success rates of 80 - 95%. However, global survival rates are quite variable and depend on the number and extent of other organ injuries, patient hemodynamic status, the delay between trauma and embolization, the experience and availability of the IR team and the number of vessels involved. Complications after embolization are usually minor and occur in less than 10% of cases. Besides the puncture site related complications, distal necrosis is a possible complication of any embolization but is not frequent in the pelvic area. Nontarget embolization due to unintentional reflux of the embolization material into the femoral artery can cause leg ischemia. Sciatic and sacral plexus palsy has been reported. Sexual dysfunction is more likely the result of nerve injury and pelvic fracture."

"ABSTRACT","Pelvic fractures are common in polytrauma and continue to pose a difficult management dilemma for even the most experienced clinicians. Due to the high energy mechanisms involved, there are often multiple other injuries and many specialists may be involved. Deriving an effective management strategy relies on early diagnosis and prioritisation of the most immediately life-threatening injuries. Contrary to ATLS advice, CT can be used to facilitate this even in the haemodynamically unstable patient.

"ABSTRACT","Embolization is an accepted alternative to surgery for patients with active bleeding related to pelvic trauma. The role of CT has significantly evolved to become an important tool in the treatment decision algorithm. In hemodynamically stable patients, contrast enhanced CT (CECT) is the preferred method of investigation. Compared to angiography (gold standard), Pereira et al. found a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 98.6% and accuracy of 98.3% using scans that were helically acquired by using 10 mm intervals with a pitch of 1.0:1 to 1.5:1. They suggested its use as a method for screening polytrauma patients with pelvic fractures to accurately identify patients who would benefit from emergent angiographic embolization. With improving technology resulting in faster image acquisition and higher resolution images, CECT is even more impressive and may even surpass conventional angiography in sensitivity. It is not generally recommended that hemodynamically unstable patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan. However, most patients with trauma suffer multi-organ injuries including brain trauma with reduce level of consciousness. A whole body CT is therefore very helpful to evaluate the extent of injuries and the best treatment approach. In fact, if a patient can tolerate CT, all other diagnostic investigations (DPL/US/laparoscopy/angiography) may not be necessary. CTA can demonstrate pelvic fractures and associated hematoma. Hematoma is the most frequent sign associated with pelvic vascular damage. The active contrast extravasation can be seen and needs to be treated in timely manner and aggressively. In case the extravasation is not seen, the progression of the hematoma in consecutive CTs is an important finding. The topographic location of extravasation and hematoma could give some indications of the vessel involved. Vessel discontinuity, pseudoaneurysm and stenosis/ spasms are other secondary signs of arterial damage. Embolization is effective in controlling the arterial hemorrhage associated to pelvic trauma. The success rate ranges between 80 and 95%. The success of embolization depends on the patient hemodynamic status, delay between the trauma and the embolization, experience of both trauma and IR teams, number of vessels involved and the extent of injuries to other organs. The above elements will affect as well the mortality rate that remains high after trauma. In a recent paper, the presence of sacroiliac joint disruption, female gender, and duration of hypotension reliably predict patients who would benefit from arterial embolization. This predictive model can help early identification of patients who would benefit from pelvic angiography. Complications related to embolization of pelvic vessels are less than 10%. Beside the well-known complications related to catheter angiography, several embolization-specific complications can occur. Embolization, by definition, reduces blood flow to the affected organ. Therefore, target and non-target organ ischemia and necrosis are recognized complications of trauma embolization. However, unintentional reflux of embolization material from the internal iliac into the femoral artery can cause inadvertent ischemia in the leg. Sciatic palsy with associated foot drop and sacral plexus palsy has been reported. Bladder ischemic lesions have also been reported. Embolization of the superior gluteal artery may result in sacral and buttock ischemia leading to skin break down. Sexual dysfunction after pelvic trauma seems not to be a complication of bilateral internal iliac artery embolization, but more likely a result of nerve injury secondary to the fracture or pelvic trauma."

"ABSTRACT","BACKGROUND: The availability of newer, faster computed tomography (CT) technology has engendered discussion about whole-body CT-scanning for primary radiological diagnostics of seriously injured patients. METHOD: Within a quality management system, the scaled, priority-oriented scheme of conventional radiological and CT-diagnostics used in each institution was analysed and compared with the possible benefit of whole-body CT-scanning. Every patient with severe trauma admitted directly from the scene of an accident, underwent basic radiological and sonographic diagnostics in the emergency room (ER). According to the findings, patients in a stable vital condition had CT-scans when indicated by the guidelines of the particular institution. RESULTS: From 5/1998 until 12/2000, a total of 832 patients were treated in the ER. Of those, 480 patients (average ISS 20) were admitted directly from the scene of the accident. Basic radiological - sonographic diagnostics (radiographs of cervical spine, chest, and abdomen, as well as abdominal sonography) took 15+/-8 min. Twenty-two (5%) of the patients in hemorrhagic shock needed emergency operations after 57+/-43 min. The remaining patients underwent further radiological diagnostics (spine, extremities etc.) after 44+/-27 min. In 79% (379) of patients, CT was indicated. Cranial CT for traumatic brain injury prevailed clearly with 74% of cases. Spine (24%), chest (18%), abdomen (5%) and pelvis (5%) were indicated comparatively less frequently. The incidence of delayed diagnoses (after ICU-admission) was 4% (22). In 2% (nine) of patients the lesions possibly could have been detected by a primary CT-scan. In the three cases with thoracic lesions, there was a deviation from the indication guidelines for thoracic CT as normally used in the institution. There were three cases of delayed diagnoses in both the cerebral (small contusion haematomas) region and the abdominal region. The abdominal lesions were detected by sonographic control examinations. No patient died because of a delayed diagnosis. The average X-ray dose was five times lower with the scaled diagnostic management comprising indicated CT when compared to the doses calculated for routine whole-body CT. CONCLUSION: While 74% of patients had cranial CT, only 25% needed CT for the trunk regions. Delayed diagnoses were rare and without severe consequences for the patient. Considering the five times higher X-ray doses combined with the possible time loss in patients with unstable conditions, primary whole-body CT-scanning should not be performed routinely when serious injury is suspected."
